# Part 1: Introduction
- > "So, unless you want to stay an ignorant, unhealthy lightweight, learn to write (and to think and communicate). Otherwise those who can will ride roughshod over you and push you out of the way. Your life will be harder, at the bottom of the dominance hierarchies that you will inevitably inhabit, and you will get old fast" (Peterson, n.d., p. 3).

- > "Donâ€™t ever underestimate the power of words. Without them, we would still be living in trees. So when you are writing an essay, you are harnessing the full might of culture to your life. That is why you write an essay (even if it has been assigned). Forget that, and you are doing something stupid, trivial and dull. Remember it, and you are conquering the unknown" (Peterson, n.d., p. 3).
- What is an essay?
	- A short piece of writing attempting to?
		- explore a topic or answer a question

- **Why bother writing an essay?**
	- To *formulate and organize*?
		- *informed, coherent, and sophisticated* ideas about **something important**
- What's students' misconception toward writing?
	- Required by instructor to write for good grade
		- Essay is for demonstrating their knowledge to a teacher/professor
- Why bother developing sophisticated ideas?
	- Because **writing is thinking**. You write to think. Why need to think?
		- Because *action based on thinking*  is likely to be **less painful** and **more productive** than *action based on ignorance*. 
		- > So, if you want to have a life characterized by competence, productivity, security, originality and engagement rather than one that is nasty, brutish and short, you need to think carefully about important issues. 
		- ***There is no better way to do so than to write.***
	- What does writing do to your thinking?
		- extends your memory
			- facilitates editing
				- clarifies your thinking
	- Because writing is a **thought filtering process**. How?
		- > "You can write down more than you can easily remember, so that your capacity to consider a number of ideas at the same time is broadened. Furthermore, once those ideas are written down, you can move them around and change them, word by word, sentence by sentence, and paragraph by paragraph. You can also reject ideas that appear substandard, after you consider them more carefully. If you reject substandard ideas, then all that you will have left will be good ideas. You can keep those, and use them. Then you will have good, original ideas at your fingertips, and you will be able to organize and communicate them" (Peterson, n.d., p. 2).
	- Because the **pen is mightier than the sword**, as the saying goes. Why?
		- > "If you sharpen your capacity to think and to communicate as a consequence of writing, you are better armed" (Peterson, n.d., p. 2).
	- How does the ability to write and edit benefit you?
		- Help you to not fall prey to?
			- *foolish fads, whims, and ideologies* by differentiating good ideas from bad ones
				- > "If you learn to write and to edit, you will also be able to tell the difference between good ideas, intelligently presented, and bad ideas put forth by murky and unskilled thinkers. That means that you will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff (look it up). Then you can be properly influenced by profound and solid ideas instead of falling prey to foolish fads and whims and ideologies, which can range in their danger from trivial to mortal" (Peterson, n.d., p. 3).
	- To be able to **think and communicate make us powerful**. Why?
		- By powerful, it means "*able to do a wide range of things
		competently and efficiently*"
		- > At the very top of the most complex hierarchies (law, medicine,
		academia, business, theology, politics) nothing is more necessary and valuable than to be able to think and communicate (Peterson, n.d., p. 3). 
	- Writing helps you **develop a well-organized and efficient mind**, one that is well-founded and certain, which results in?
		- healthier you mentally and physically
