## Draft
I have always been passionate about making a difference by saving the environment. I dream about living simply and harmoniously with nature leaving very minimal footprint behind on our planet. I visualize myself living off grid on a medium side Permaculture homestead at the suburb of the city where I grow my own food, work part-time from home, and spending quality time with my family. It's an ideal life for me. 

This passion and dream got me deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole of sustainable agriculture. I have been researching online, watching tones of short and long documentary videos of inspiring stories and movements led by people of different ages, skin colors, ethnic groups, and cultures around the globe advocating and practicing various types of sustainable agriculture ranging from regenerative agriculture and Permaculture all the way to the small scale market gardening. 

I have learned about all the positive impacts that all these sustainable agricultural practices are proven to have on our natural ecosystem --the soil, the biodiversity, and the climate-- our economics, and our food security. I have learned a possible way to produce healthy and nutrient-rich food to feed our population while tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emission, capturing carbon into our soil, maintaining and improving the soil, protecting and increasing our biodiversity, saving the water, and  eliminate agricultural polution. It inspires me and gets me super excited to tell my country to adopt these practices too. 

I started talking about it with friends, family, agricultural students, farmers, villagers, government officers, and business owners. I realized that not many people are aware of the term sustainable agriculture and don't have to mentioned regenerative agriculture, Permaculture, or market gardening. We have not faced critical direct impact from climate change or barren soil yet. Therefore, everyone in particular farmers don't really care about their conventional agricultural practices that raise the economic growth on the expense of our natural ecosystem. 

I realized that Cambodian farmers learn best from other farmers not really from lectures, training, or workshops. They need someone to take risks first, lead the way by setting working successful example for them. From what I found out, up until today we only have examples of profit-driven farm business which push for economics growth in the expense of our natural ecological system. We don't hear stories of a role model who successfully & profitably adopts sustainable agriculture practice, and is focusing on spreading the knowledge or sharing their story. This is where Dassatek comes in. Dassatek's mission is to create that story and assist youths together with farmers in adopting sustainable agriculture throughout Cambodia and beyond by...


## Introduction Draft
We do not have to repeat the same mistakes the world has already made. We don't have to value economics growth over the well-being of our ecosystem and environment. We don't have to value quick short-term commercial gain over long-term sustainable future for our children. Cambodia relies heavily on agriculture. The majority of our farmers are small scale farmers meaning access to farm land hasn't been completely monopolized by any big corporate yet. We still have a lot of arable land meaning our soil isn't that bad yet. Therefore, we are actually in a very good position if we do it right. What does it mean "to do it right"?

We need to adopt sustainable agriculture to increase sustainably production and income, to adapt and build resilience to the impact of climate change, and wherever possible to reduce greenhouses. Otherwise, we will suffer the most because small scale farmers are shown to be the most vulnerable. The question is "How are we going to get our country and farmers to adopt sustainable agriculture?" This is where we come in. Dassatek assists Cambodian youths and farmers in adopting sustainable agriculture to adapt to climate change through our farm bootcamp.
