- Why do you care? 
	- Cambodia does not have to repeat the same mistakes the world has already made. We don't have to value economics growth over the well-being of our ecosystem and environment or value quick short-term financial gain over long-term sustainable future for our children. In contrast, we can choose to do what is right. That leads us to one of our greatest challenges, how are we going to change the course of our country's agricultural development strategy and farmer's agricultural practice from exclusively pursuing the modern industrial agriculture model that degrades our soil, depletes our water, decreases our biodiversity, destroys our ecosystem, and contributes heavily to climate change toward a more sustainable and regenerative agriculture?

- Why is it important? What it's about? 
	- Cambodia relies heavily on agriculture. ***The majority of our farmers are small scale farmers*** meaning access to farm land hasn't been completely monopolized by any big corporate yet. Moreover, ***we still have a lot of arable land*** which means our soil isn't completely degraded. Therefore, we are actually in a better position to choose to do the right thing. We need to adopt sustainable agriculture to sustainably increase production and income, adapt and build resilience to the impact of climate change, and wherever possible reduce greenhouse gases. Otherwise, we will suffer the most ***because small scale farmers are shown to be the most vulnerable***. This is what our project will focus on. 
	- Dassatek, meaning "to awaken" in Khmer, is created inspire and assist Cambodian youths and farmers in adopting sustainable agriculture to adapt to climate change through our market gardening farm bootcamp. 

- Why I pick Market Gardening farm bootcamp? (How it help farmer adapt to climate change?) Successful Implementation in Siem Reap by CE SAIN. This is a working model.
	- Dassatek's farm bootcamp Farmers learn best from other farmers and by doing it themselves. 


- Why do we choose to run farm bootcamp?
	- In Cambodia, we have had sustainable agriculture training, workshops, local researches, university courses, capacity building projects, pilot projects, and community initiatives. Non-governmental organizations, both local and international, private sectors, and governmental sectors have shown effort in educating youths and farmers about climate change and its impacts on our food security. However, there are still very few stakeholders who actually believe in it enough to adopt sustainable farming for their agriculture venture. We believe that what youths and farmers are really missing is the role models and successful stories of someone in Cambodia who actually successfully adopt it. 
- Why we choose youths & farmers?
	- We choose youth, agriculture youths or general youths who are very passionate about sustainable agriculture, and farmer, farmers from our partner agriculture cooperatives, as our target audiences or participation groups because youths can be very creative and open-minded toward new ideas or any new method of farming especially if it gives meaning to their lives by allowing them to make a difference in the world on top of just making a fortune. On the other hands, farmers might be less creative and open-minded because they are mostly old people, but their experiences are priceless. Thus, combining the two groups together will allow them to learn from one another and collaborate with each other to solve problems effectively and efficiently. 
	- Our project idea consists of two phases.  
	
- What is the idea for farm bootcamp?
	- The first phase, our farm bootcamp, is a very project-based training program which brings passionate youths and farmers together to learn about how to run a market gardening farm and practice running it hands-on from March until December 2022 with YSEALI's seed grant. 
	
	We will start by conducting workshops and social media campaigns to recruit 20 teams, 2 people per team, to join the program. By the end of the training, five teams will be selected based on their farm business plans and farm designs to start growing vegetable and implementing their business plans for six months on our 1.67 acre (~6800 sqm) of land in CE SAIN's agricultural technology park at the Royal University of Agriculture in Phnom Penh. At the end of the program, the five farms will be evaluated, and we expect program to reach 5000 audiences to raise their awareness on climate change's impact on our food security and to inspire 10 participants from the five teams to be our first change agents by starting their own market gardening afterward. 
		
	- After the first phase, our objective for the second phase is to assist farmers in replicating market gardening in our 5 partner agricultural cooperatives which we have access to work with through our other partner and mentor, Cambodia Partnership for Sustainable Agriculture. In this phase, Dassatek will find the market in Phnom Penh for farmers's produces and build a decentralized platform using existing social media  or building a website and mobile application, where they can sell their produces directly to households and organic restaurants. We don't want to be their middle man because we don't want them to depend on us forever. 

	- Instead, we want to help them to be able to run their farm business by themselves. To do that, we can start by providing them services such as technical support on how to run a market gardening, regular monitoring and consulting through our youth agents, vegetable delivery, and marketing or accounting assistance. They can stop using any of our service whenever they think they're ready to handle it themselves. Another way we can work with them is to supply them resources such as tools and equipment specifically required to run a market gardening farm, composts, vegetable seeds, natural fertilizer, and so on. The goal is to assist and empower each agriculture cooperative to be able to provide all these products and services to its members by itself. That leaves Dassatek to do only one job, to continue assisting farmers in replicating the system in all agricultural cooperatives throughout Cambodia. 

Proposed solution / Proposed plan

Measurable outcome and measurable impact

- Conclusion
	- Hopefully, we can get our current farmers to embark on our journey toward creating more prosperous and sustainable food production system and inspire next generation farmers to farm in harmony with nature. 
	- By proving to farmer that market gardening works in the context of our country (produce enough vegetable and have the market) through our successful hands-on farm bootcamp and finding the market for them to sell their produces to, we can increase the chance that they will be convinced to adapt this sustainable farming technique to implement in their community. This is what makes our program more effective and unique that other programs sustainable agriculture training, workshop... 

- Provides tools, resources, and support to help a new generation of entrepreneurial, ecological farmers to get their farms off the ground and to thrive. 
- We need young farmers, new farmers, and more farmers to revitalize our rural communities, root resilient and sustainable food systems, and provide careful stewardship of our agricultural resources for generations to come. 


To get more youths into farming, they need more than just a way to make a living but to do something that adds meaning to their lives.
