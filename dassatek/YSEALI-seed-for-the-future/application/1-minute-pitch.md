### Problem? & Why?

- Our country relies heavily on agriculture. 
- The majority of our farmers are small scale farmers. 
- Research has shown that they are the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.
- Not many people are aware of climate change and its impact on agriculture
- At the same time, there's trend toward conventional farming

- We still have a lot of arable land meaning our soil isn't that bad yet. 

We do not have to repeat the same mistakes the world has already made. We don't have to value economics growth over the well-being of our ecosystem and environment. We don't have to value quick short-term commercial gain over long-term sustainable future for our children. 

Therefore, we are actually in a very good position if we do it right. What does it mean "to do it right"?

We need to adopt sustainable agriculture to adapt to climate change. Otherwise, we will suffer the most because small scale farmers are shown to be the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The question is "How are we going to get our country and farmers to adopt sustainable agriculture?" This is where Dassatek comes in. 	 



he majority of our farmers are small scale farmers meaning access to farm land hasn't been completely monopolized by any big corporate yet. 

We still have a lot of arable land meaning our soil isn't that bad yet. 

Therefore, we are actually in a very good position if we do it right. What does it mean "to do it right"?

	
### Project Objective
- To raise awareness about climate change and agriculture among youths and farmers 
- To adopt and pilot market gardening in Cambodia
- To prepare to implement market gardening in Agricultural Cooperatives

### Solution?
- Phase 1: YSEALI 
	- Select 20 teams (2 people = 1 team)
	- Train them run a market gardening vegetable farm business
	- Submit Farm Business & Design
	- Select 5 teams
	- Implementation for 5-6 months (Run real business farm)
	- Harvesting 
	- Evalution

- Phase 2: After YSEALI
	- Implement market gardening farm system at ACs
	- Provide small start-up loan without interest
	- Build Direct Selling platform (web/app) 
		- allow farmers to sell directly to customer
	- Provide them services:
		- Support them with the technical on farming aspect
		- Do regular monitoring from our team
		- **Find them vegetable market in PP**
		- Do marketing for them
		- Assist them in finance
		- Support them with distribution (vegetable cool chain)
	- Provide them products:
		- Supply them tools, equipment, resources, compost...
	

### How?
- How to attract youths?
- How to convince farmers?
- How to public awareness about the threat climate change put on agriculture?

### Expected outcome?
- 5K reach social campaign
- 40 youths and farmers trained about sustainable vegetable farming "Market Gardening"
- Successfully run 5 pilot market gardening farm 
- Have 1 AC who agree to implement market gardening after the program

### Why market gardening?
- How does it help farmers adapt and build resilience to the impact of  climate change?
- How does it increase sustainably production and income?
- How does it mitigate climate change?

### Research & Additional Information

I have a sustainable vegetable farming model called 

**"Market Gardening"** 
- Protect rain flood, water conservation, soil erosion
	- Minimum Tillage
	- Permanent Beds 
	- Cover crop & Mulching 
	- Drip Irrigation & Rain Water Harvesting
-  Build soil/improve soil fertility, reduce farmer's reliance on chemical input
	- Natural Fertilizer
	- Compost
	- Poultry Manure
	- Green Manure and Cover Crops 
- Risk management, pest management, disease management
	- Crop diversification 
	- Inter-cropping (integrated pest management)
	- Plant Integration (provide shade, increase biodiversity)
	- Crop Rotation (disease management)
- Appropriate Machinery
	- Minimum start-up cost
	- Minimum Production Costs
	- Small Scale

**Key to Success:**
- Biologically Intensive Approach : maximize crop yields from a minimum area of land, while seeking to preserve or even improve the quality of the soil.
	- grow our crops in permanent raised bed
	- large quantity of organic matter to built soil and create rich and living soil
	- no-dig : limiting any turning of the soil
	- closely spacing the crops 
	- planting as many succession crops as possible
- Minimizing Start-up Costs
- Minimizing Production Costs
- Direct Selling
- Adding Value to the Crops
- Learning the Craft

**Working Model in Siem Reap by CE SAIN:**
- Conservation Agriculture
	- Minimum Mechanical Soil Disturbance
	- Permanent Soil Organic Cover
	- Species Diversification
- Integrated Pest Management
- Drip Irrigation
- Harvest and Post Harvest Techniques
- Sorting, packaging, and storage
- Door-to-Door marketing
	

**Climate Smart Agriculture**
- Climate Change Adaptation
	- Diversifying production systems
	- Resilient crop varieties or livestock breeds
	- Adjusting cropping times
	- Improving irrigation and drainage systems
	- Prevent erosion
	- Improve soil fertility
