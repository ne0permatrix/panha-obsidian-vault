#### Feeling Hopeless Social Business Application & Corruption
**Reflection or Revelation:**

**Feeling Hopeless - Microfinance/Social Business in Cambodia**
- Today after dinner I asked my mother to share her experience and knowledge related to microfinance. She worked for CONCERN and AMK Microfinance. What works in Bangladesh didn't work here. Borrowers took the loan, spent it, and never paid back. My aunt, E Prok and my cousin, Sereyrath, also shared their experiences. All sharing seems to add up to one conclusion, it's Cambodian people's mindset (អត់គំនិត). They always want quick result, easy path, and gift. They want people to give them fish other than teaching them how to fish.   
- My mother added, "CONCERT did all of that", giving loan to poor family without work, providing agricultural training, initiating saving habit, buying safe for community to use as a bank, selecting representatives...
- We also went on to talk about our provincial governor and corruption, how powerful people team up with unethical rich people who are thirsty for money and willing to do whatever they have to without caring about the poor, environment, nature, the country, the earth...
- Hearing all these just makes me feel hopeless. I questioned myself if I gave up on the idea of working with the community to bring prosperity to them and raise them out of poverty. I questioned myself if I just went on to doing market gardening and focusing on running a successful farm business with it. Then let's see if the poor or underprivileged find it interested, they can reach out to me then I can help.  
- At the same time, I think what I can do to find out more why social business/microfinance work in Bangladesh and else where, but not in Cambodia. I can create a questionnaire and interview my mother, Keang, Bong Lykeang, Bong Mao...

#### Feeling Down, Disappointed, Insecure
**Reflection or Revelation:**

Today I was peer-reviewing my classmates' discussion assignment. There was this one guy, Ankinbile Gabriel, who is very at writing. His work was so good, very well written and researched. Check "Example of A Good Work from Akinbile Gabriel" in [[UNIV1001-W5-self-directed-learning]]. 

Self-doubt and insecurity. Am I of any good? I seem to be all over the places. What's my skill? Am I going to amount to something? Am I even good at something? Will I be a successful business person? 

When you can't make it or achieve what you told other people you will do, you damage your self-esteem. Then the above feeling and questions are likely to come out and hit you. 

When you are struggling with something or not doing well at something, you start comparing yourself to others who are better than you. Then you begin to again to question yourself, your self-worth, and doubt your own ability.

- **My Insecurity**:
	- I think I am good at writing. Turn out there is other people who is doing way better than me. My work is nothing special.
	- I am struggling to meet UoPeople's assignment deadline, while a couple of other people seem to be doing very good at it.
	- I don't have any income.
	- I stop and change from one place to another when it comes to work. Am I a jack of all trade? I am not skillful in anything. I am not good at anything. 
	- I am indecisive. It takes me so long to make certain decision (buying a laptop, whether or not to buy a motorbike). 
	- I can't even backup my own decision (say 3ZERO Club question about what area of focus, I chose agriculture but can't tell why. I decided to buy PTT2 land to get to know people from FHF and learn about investment and opportunity). 
	- I am good at only learning, but when it comes to applying it in real life I suck. (បានតែរៀនតែធ្វើអ្វីមិនកើត។ ទាល់ដូចបងឬទ្ធីបានល្អ។ ធ្វើបណ្តើររៀនបណ្តើរ មិនបាច់ទៅសាលាទេ។)

#### Found the vision, Feeling Hopeful
**Reflection or Revelation:**

Today, I found a video from Ted Talk on YouTube which gave me a vision, hope, direction, and clarity on what to believe or aim for for the future.

Before I found this video, there were only voices or perspectives or narratives that  either over-emphasize on high-tech, machinized, and corporate, huge commercial, profit-driven, production-thirsty, and economic-growth-focused ways of farming or the labor intensive, low-tech, hand tools, local, small scale, ecologically-focused ways of farming.
It was hard for me to decide what side to pick or if there's a middle way. 

This video provides me the middle way of farming which will produce food to feed the world while maintaining or improving our ecosystem. 

That to me is the future farming that we should be aiming for.

I am very grateful for :
- myself today for working on YSEALI idea formulation very hard
- 3ZERO team for tuning in and staying with me till the end
- the cool weather because of the rain
- for YEA team and Je Keang for cooking and creating a very fun and nice environment here in Siem Reap

#### Impatient, Feeling disappointed, Not doing good at university, Poor Reading Comprehension
**Reflection or Revelation:**

Today I have been feeling unhappy with my ability to read and comprehend information from my BUS1101 textbook. I felt like I am not very good at reading comprehension yet. I am so slow.

#### Starting Business from a vision vs. from a problem
**Reflection or Revelation**

I used to struggle putting my vision into a business plan, because I began with a vision, 

After learned about the process of creating a business model & plan from CPSA & Impact HUB, I noticed that we are taught to begin not by a vision or mission, but by identifying a problem and targeted customer. 

These are two different approaches. Which one would work best?

#### Feeling Confused, overwhelmed, and unorganized in term of my ideas in my head

**Reflection or Revelation:**

Feeling Confused and a little bit overwhelmed with all the unorganized ideas in my head.

What triggered the feeling? I started to feel like that after I talked about farming business ideas with Bong Keang. There are many issues in agriculture and what I thought was the issue and wanted to focused on  wasn't really it. That kind of makes me overwhelmed. Another thing is that I can't just come up with a business plan yet. My thoughts are not clear or well-organized at all. I still can't identify the real problem the target customers are facing.  

Then in the evening in van on the way back from Angkor Supermarket in Siem Reap, I saw Melanie posted a blog about her personal thoughts or vision on what Cambodia would be like in 2030 in different sectors. I read about all the start-ups or businesses mentioned by Melanie in her writing. They seem to be doing good and are so amazing. I began to feel even down as I was comparing myself to them. I don't know what this feeling is called or what I was experiencing.

Another part of why I had all these feelings was because I think I am overwhelmed with what is coming next, my UoPeople weekly assignment and final, YSEALI application, and CPSA.

I even question myself who the fuck I am. I am even good for. What's my purpose? I am SAD man...

I used to go through this before man. I remembered I was standing in front of my room at Olympics and weeping.

Kind of miss my dad too. I know it has been a while, 3 years now. Miss his voice. One thing I know is that he worked hard. He changed. And I am always proud of him. (wheeping...)

To deal with this, I wept and let all the emotion out. Then I ended up watching like movie for 30 minutes. I decided to stop watching and told myself that I had to go to bed early or otherwise I wouldn't be able to wake up earlier and stick with my studying schedule. That would then have spiral effect on my other priorities and schedule. 

This is where self-discipline came into play. Learn to be able to quick let let the emotion out, then come back to the plan. ឈប់បណ្តែតបណ្តោយតាមអារម្មណ៍យូរពេក។ Think about the consequence of my current action. If I continued to watch the movie till the end, I would go to bed at 1AM or something. That would have a bad consequence on my next day plan.

#### Feeling doubtful, Not have farming experience

**Reflection or Revelation:**

It's a bit scary and daunting to think about growing vegetable or starting a market gardening with not much experience when it comes to growing organic vegetables. 

But I think what really troubles me isn't that I don't believe in myself that I can do it even though I am not super experienced, but it's the thought about what people might be thinking about me doing it that kind of makes me doubt myself. I know it's not really a good thing to think about others would think of what you want to do, but it's at the same time difficult to not care about what they think as running a successful market gardening will required me or the farm to work with people or CSA members. 

I think what triggered me to feel this way is the post below in the picture. It is a post from one of the leading center at RUA who is also advocating about sustainable agriculture. When I saw this post, what went through my mind is "Shit they have got a team of experts doing something similar to what I am about to do. What are they going to think about what I am proposing to them? Are they going to think I am stupid or something hearing my idea?"

![[Pasted image 20211028164044.png]]

It's difficult to find someone who is experienced in this type of farming philosophy or selling model in Cambodia. This type of vegetable farming is pretty new to Cambodia; therefore, whoever decided to take the lead will face challenges. That's what I am going to experience, but it would be worth it because I am making way for next generation farmers to follow. Hopefully, we can gather more like-minded farmers to aim toward a more sustainable way of farming. Hopefully, more people can farm in harmony with nature. 

I think it also has to do my level of confidence. I now to be honest question myself sometime, will people like my idea? Are they going to support it? What if they don't like or support it? However, I also believe that it's a matter of getting started, getting out there, communicating my vision and passion to them, attracting those who believe in the same vision, forgetting those who don't, moving on, improving, developing, and working step-by-step toward the ultimate goal. I think this is just part of the nature of starting up a business. It's quite similar to when I started pursuing my cycling dream as well. The only difference is that my cycling journey didn't depend strongly on collaboration with other people. 

I think using YSEALI grant will give me a very great opportunity to pilot market gardening farm. I will be able to get started and experiment with it to see if it works in Cambodian climate and for Cambodian market. At the same time, I will be able to collect all the necessary localized data about what type of vegetable grow well, which ones are the most profitable per sqm, what challenges or issues presented, what solutions we have, how people will react to this form vegetable production, how customers will react or say about this type of market channel... 

With all these critical information, I will be able to put together a solid business plan backed up by solid previous experience to pitch to investors, households, and restaurants to find out if they want to be a shareholders/members of our farm CSA. I believe that this experience with the Dassatek's Pilot Farm Bootcamp will give me a lot of confidence. 

I think the solution out of this kind of feeling is to learn from successful people whose ideas were rejected, not believed in, and not supported for countless time, but they remained determined and had the grit to stick to their ideas until they succeeded. A good example is Elon Musk, the rejection from NASA... So go study Elon's Musk story.
