I used to think that going back to school to take business administration major will teach me about how to run a business or start-up a business. I think that I am intimidated by the idea of running a business. I even used to  view business negatively in a sense that all business people are money-driven individuals who think of nothing but maximizing profit out of their business.  I believe that ignorance plays a huge part in ingraining in me this perspective. Going back to school will allow me to become educated about it and hopefully I will overcome the fear or change my negative perception toward business and business-oriented people. 

Then there is another important reason.

I view university experience or investment as a mean for me to develop and improve my critical thinking skill, reading skill, writing skill, and communication skills (writing & public speaking). In another word, I view the experience as a way to learn how to learn. 

Think about Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezo, Jack Ma... What do they have in common?

They love reading. They possess reading habit. They read a lot. They read everyday. They are constantly taking in inputs and processing them into something useful for their day-to-day decision. Not only do they read, but the effectiveness of how they sythensize and internalize the information is so extraordinary. Therefore, **if my four years at college could help me build the reading habit and increase my reading comprehensiveness to the same level as these guys', I will be satisfied**. My 4-year commitment will be worth it. 

Even most of these guys dropped out, but think about it. What sort of high school education were they in? Or what sort of culture or family were they growing up with? The answer to these questions could potentially explain something about their mindset and critical thinking ability. For those who got into the university in the US, they proved one thing already. They proved that they are already at another or in a different class compared to us in Cambodia. Thus, to get to their level, we need to build our knowledge and increase our skillsâ€”thinking skill, reading skill, communicating skills in a form of writing and public speaking. 

So forget about what if I am only good at learning from the book, but I can't apply what I learned in real life. What if I am only doing good at learning how to do business in class, but I can't start-up a successful business in reality. FORGET IT...! Even if that was true, it was fine too because ***what I expected to get out of my university experience is to learn how to learn, to develop my critical thinking, reading, writing, public speaking, and communicating skill, and to build connections.*** Even if I have to start running business from level 0 in term of experience, that is fine too, because I know with the skill sets I have developed, I will learn how to run a business faster and make more good decisions which will lead to success. 

It is not too late. I am not 30 years old yet. Jack Ma once said,"Before 20 years old, be a good student. Before 30 years old, find good boss to work for. Before 40 years old, work for yourself start a business. Before 50 years old, focus on your strength in the business. Before 60 years old, help young peoples. When you're over 60 years old, retire and enjoy the your remaining life." I am only 25 years old now (by October 14, 2021). Therefore, I can spend the next 5 years of my life learning from university, traveling, working for different bosses just to learn about myself and the world. Then when I am 30 years old, I should have had a solid idea of what I want to start-up a business with. From there I can just dive in head first. 

Specialty or technical skill sets are secondary, because when I know how to learn, read, think, synthesize, internalize, and communicate information or thought, I will be unstoppable. With the power of internet, access to data isn't a problem anymore, but whether or not you have the ability to critically analyze and make use of those data is. 

Why go back to school? Why want to go to McGill University?
- to develop these skills: active learning, critical thinking, reading, writing, public speaking, communicating (university is like an arena for me to force myself to learn and practice all these skill sets)
- to build connections
- to expose to different cultures, mindsets, and ideas/ to see the world


#### SmallWorld Case Study
Because of the different level of knowledge acquisition, access to the latest trends, innovation, or research, critical thinking, and ability to synthesize and internalize those information, guys like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezo, Jack Ma have an edge over so many people. I don't mean this to be an excuse. I too can get to this level. 

For SmallWorld, Bong Rithy alone would not have made what SmallWorld is now. Charles was a machine that brought in the latest trends and information while having a vision that led them to grab the opportunity in Cambodia. Not many people know Charles or his background. From what I know, he was doing well in college. He has also shown an extraordinary level of critical thinking, reading, writing, and researching skill. 

Bong Rithy on the other hand is the local guy who is into representing the face of the company. He likes social networking, exposing himself to the public, dare to take risk, and 

## I really don't want to keep comparing myself to him or SW.
