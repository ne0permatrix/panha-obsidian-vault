To not be too focus on detail when I am reading

When I am reading, I have this fear of missing out. It's like I am constantly worried about not being able to grab all the information and retain them. 

I think part of reason why I am like this because I have not mastered how to read for key ideas, author's perspective...

This is part of active reading skill.
