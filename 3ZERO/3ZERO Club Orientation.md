What is our team next process?
=> To be honest, in term of progress, we have been struggling quite a bit with initiating learning activities as each member has their other work/study/responsibility of their own. 
=> For 2022, we set ourselves two goals:
1 - to cover the material on 3ZERO Club and Social Business
2 - to help other youths form 2 more clubs

What is our team's vision regarding our 3ZERO Club?
=> As a team, we actually haven't really established a specific vision for our club yet. Each of our members is still exploring with what we really want to focus on in term of our passions or the problem to solve. We basically created this club with one main purpose for the moment to stay connected to social business movement and network.


Why did you decide to form this club?
- Personally, I just want to learn more about social business because it gives me hope. I grew up hating and being intimidated by business and business people. I used to tell myself I am not a business person and that I will never ever do business. I just want to live a simple life and make impact on our society and ecosystem. I don't want to be rich. Last year, I found out about social business by Prof. Muhhamad Yunus. The finding changed my mindset and attitude toward business. It shows me that there's actually an alternative to our main stream business. This is why I want to get deeper into it. And I believe that 3ZERO club is a great platform to start.
