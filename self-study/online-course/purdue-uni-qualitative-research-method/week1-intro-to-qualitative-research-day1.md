- What is quantitative research?
	- Measurable Data
		- The information gathered using quantitative research is normally measurable. For example, it could be people's height, distance, number of times...
	- Numerical Variable
		- Quantitative research involves with numerical data. 
	- Big Sample Size
		- Normally conducted with hug sample size. 
	- Answer the question "What?"
		- To establish a conclusion of what is happening or what something is based on measurable or numerical data. 
	- Experiment-based
		- It involves experimentation to collect and gather numerical and measurable data which can be used to make an inference about what happens or what something is. 
- What is qualitative research?
	-	Based on "Observation" & "Interview"

	- Numerical data or measurable data
- Is there other form of science?
	- Yes, there is other forms science. 



#### Question
- Can qualitative data be used in laboratory research? Or which one is used more in laboratory research, quantitative or qualitative?
- Why do we normally use huge sample size in quantitative research?
