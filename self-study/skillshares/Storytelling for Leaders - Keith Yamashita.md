**Course Title**: Storytelling for Leaders - How to craft stories that matter by Keith Yamashita

## 4 Types of Story
1. **Story of Me**
Ex: Opera Winfree
2. **Story of Our Company**
Why do we exist? 
What is our purpose?
What is important?
What really matters to us? 
Ex: AirBnB
3. **The Story of an Idea**
Ex: Steve Jobs. He mesmorized you with the story of a product or an idea in the world and showed you a possibility you hadn't seen before. Your mind is opened to a new way that "Product could satisfy things in our world." 
4.  **The Story of Results**
Ex: Mark Zaceburge.
Imagine a day when...
He starts with a result. It is talking about what we hope for, but also what we've created. 

## Making Your Story
### Components of Your Story
**Directions** : find the components of your great story
1. Select 4-5 components that seem particularly suited to the story you to tell.
2. Write in your own details in the blank space  on the cards provided--short sentences or bullet points will do. 
3. When you've filled in your 4-6 cards, cut them out and set them aside. You're going to need them later. 

**Once upon a time...**
Setting the scene can help the audience connect to the story as if they were there when it happened. *What's the scene for your story?*

**A world view**
Many great stories have perspective--an angle or lens that shapes the telling of the story and what people take away from it. *What perspective does your story offer?*

**Great Character**
Heroes. Villains. Supporting characters. Who or what you choose--and what their characteristics and traits are--is critical to the action and meaning of your story. *Who are the great characters in your story?*

**Challenging situations**
We learn a lot about people through their toughest moments--their near-death experiences, moments of lapsed judgment, and fables. *What challenging situations surface in your story?*

**Conflict**
Challenging situations and moments of change naturally lead to conflict--between people, values, the past versus the future, big bets versus the status quo. *What conflict arises in your story?*

**Drama**
A heightened sense of drama keeps the audience riveted to the story. *What's the drama in your story?*

**Lessons Learned**
Everyone has learned lessons through experiences that are worthy of sharing. *What lessons are learned in, or from, your story?*

**New Possibility**
When your story is about what might be possible in the future--not just what has happened in the past--a story might include a future view. *What possibilities does your story illustrate?*

**Happily ever after...**
Sometimes the job of a story is to leave the audience with a sense of resolution and wellbeing. *What's the warm, fuzzy feeling we get from your story?*

That stories that captivate you are built on components. Above are nine of them, but not all nine will be in every story. In fact, some stories only have 3-4 of these components.  

### Archetype
**Coming of Age**
After yours of learning and growing, you've reached a milestone. You know who you are. You are strong, experienced, and confident. You're ready to take on whatever comes next. *Use this archetype to show experience and strength.*
Ex: Going through an experience makes you stronger. 

**Overcoming Obstacles**
You hit a roadblock and almost failed. It was a struggle. You challenged your assumptions, made tough decisions, fought hard...and won. *Use this archetype to demonstrate resilience(being able to come back)*

**Constant Evolution**
You never rest. Over and over, you've evolved to handle whatever comes your way. You keep moving, adapting to the world around you and maybe even anticipating its change. *Use this archetype to prove adaptability.*

**True As It Ever Was**
Your purpose and values have endured throughout the years. The world has evolved and you've changed with it, but your core beliefs have remained intact. They guide everything you do. *Use this archetype to communicate steadiness or reinforce the audience's trust.*

**Rebirth**
Over time, you've accumulated a wealth of experience and knowledge. Today, you're harnessing that to start a whole new chapter, and become an even better version of yourself. *Use this archetype to explain a new direction.*

**Quest**
You've always had a clear objective and you're pursued it relentlessly. Over time, you've summoned your talent and passion to turn your vision into reality. Through twists and turns, you've maintained your focus, and you will never let it go. *Use these archetype to recommit or demonstrate dedication.*

Think for a moment of each of these archetypes and which one might help you accomplish what you most want to accomplish with an audience.

**Happily ever after...**



We all are a part of an eco-system--bacteria, fungus, earthwarm, ants, soil, water, air, animals, birds, trees, plants. There has to be a balance. Otherwise, there will be issues. We human have segregated ourselves from nature. We do whatever we alter, manipulate, and exploit everything we set foot on so that we can become the dominant. This is imbalance. This is root cause of many troubles human are facing now: climate change... If we consider ourselves as a part of something very dear to us, we won't do anything to damage it. 

Imagine a world where we farm harmoniously with nature, where we design a system that mimik nature to produce food for us at the same serve everything else in the eco-system, where technology is used to not ignore, replace, or destroy nature, but to assist human in how to farm successfully in harmony with nature. 

When farming is more than just a survival work, but a crucial work that serve a greater purpose, the ecosystem, farmers will have joy and pride in their work. They will be able to live a fulfilling life. In the past, farming is view as a profession for the poors, the uneducated, labour work not brain work, hard work under the sun, the rain, the wind...

Cambodia does not have to repeat the same mistakes the world has already made. We don't have to value economic growth over the well-being of our ecosystem and environment or value quick short-term financial gain over a long-term sustainable future for our children. In contrast, we can choose to do what is right.
