### Analysis

### Lesson Learned
1. **You can only short at one position**. 
	- When you are shorting, you can only short at one position. If you set up a new short, then the system will cancel the previous "Take Profit" and "Stop Loss" and add up the new amount of coins you asked the system to short to the previous amount of coins.

2. **Don't forget to set "Take Profit" and "Stop Loss" !**
	- That was what I didn't do and I ended up lossing 189usd before the I think stop me/cut me off. 
3. ** Set "Stop Loss" above the resistance level. **
