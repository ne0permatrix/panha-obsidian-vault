### Analysis
- I did this set up because 
	- the price of SLP has already reached the lowest support on Sep 21, 2021
		![[Screenshot from 2021-10-03 13-07-39.png]]
	- the price has bounced back off that support
	- the price is moving on an up-trend
	- the trading volume has already increased in the last 12 days since Sep 23, 2021 (two days after the price reached the lowest support)
