- I planned to take profit at 11.95 USDT ~ **7.36 USDT (Profit)**

### Analysis
- I saw that the price has dropped and reached the support @10.254USDT.
- I think it is going to bounce back (no proof to support this actually, didn't do fundamental research)

### Lesson Learned
- At 17:03:49 on November 16, 2021, my Stop/Limit order was executed. I only realized this on 17th because I think there was a delay due to Binance system. 
- So I lost 2.67USDT.
