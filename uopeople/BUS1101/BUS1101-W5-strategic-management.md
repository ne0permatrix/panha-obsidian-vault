# Introduction
What is strategy? When your friend tells you that his "strategy" in basketball is to win, he is not telling you a strategy at all. A strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a goal--in the case of your friend, a more appropriately defined strategy for his basketball game would be: "I am going to apply defensive pressure and force the opposing team to make mistakes with the end goal of winning the game." In this course, you will learn that you must first clearly define your goals before you develop strategies in order to achieve them. You will also learn that strategy in business is similar to strategy in sports, war, or politics; the parallels are so close that early business strategists studied military strategies in depth. The science of strategy development has developed beyond this by now, but the parallels still exist.

Strategic management involves two processes: first, the process of identifying specific goals for a firm and designing strategies to achieve those goals, and second, the process of implementing those strategies. It is easy to say that your goal is to increase sales by 50% in three years, but how do you go about achieving that goal? Are you going to lower prices, acquire a competitor, move into other businesses, or something else? Assuming you are going to lower prices, how are you going to do so and keep profits up? These are the sorts of questions that strategists must answer.

## My Work
What negative consequences can emerge when vision, mission, or values contradict strategy?

Strategy tells what an organization should do or should not do in order to achieve a state of its mission and vision through accomplishing specific goals and objectives (Carpenter et al., 2010, p. 224). Strategy is a bridge that connects the goals and objectives to the mission and vision. If vision, mission, or values contradict strategy, it could negatively affect different stakeholders. First, employees work on tasks that don't align with the organizaion's mission and vision which is a waste of time and human resource. Second, because the organization isn't doing things that aligns with its mission and vision, it will also lose its customers' trust and damage its branding. Third, it could also experience financial loss because of the first two reasons. Last but not least, its shareholders might pull off their investment fund and abandon the organization, which leads to organization's bankruptcy.  

Name a time where you believe strategy was not aligned with vision, mission, or values.

A good example for this would be from Dell Computer. Carpenter et al. (2010) wrote in their book: 	
	For instance, Dell Computer’s strategy is highly focused around the efficient sale and manufacture of computers and computer peripheral devices. However, during the mid-2000s, Dell started branching out into other products such as digital cameras, DVD players, and flat-screen televisions. As a result, it lost focus on its core sales and manufacturing business, and its performance flagged. (p. 237)

How can leaders ensure that strategy matches the vision, mission, and values?

Leaders can ensure that strategy matches the vision, mission, and values by conducting conducting SWOT analysis to identify its strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat before formulating the intended strategy. "Only 10%-30% of intended strategy is realized" (Carpenter et al., 2010, p. 234). That's alone not enough. Leaders should to provide considerable freedom for divisional and business unit managers to adjust, adapt, and experiment with the new strategy (Carpenter et al., 2010, p. 236). This way they can also reflect and give feedback to top level management to make necessary modification.

# Written Assignment
Recall that in a SWOT analysis, the Strengths and Weaknesses are internal. This means that the organization has more control over these factors. The opportunities and threats are external, meaning that they have little to no influence over them. Read the following case study and provide three strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (each) for Athlete’s Warehouse.  Provide an analysis of each of these, including the justification for why you chose them. Also, provide an overall evaluation of the organization based on the SWOT analysis.

Case Study: Howse, B. (1992). _Athlete's warehouse (A)_. Atlantic Entrepreneurial Institute. Download the [pdf](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1402440/mod_book/chapter/293741/Unit%205%20Case%20Study%20--%20Athlete%20Warehouse.pdf?time=1581718546499).

Prepare a two-page (double-spaced) essay. Cite references, using APA format, for any material that you use in preparing the essay.

Papers will be assessed on the following criteria:
-   The strengths are correctly analyzed from the case study and are internal.  
-   The weaknesses are correctly analyzed from the case study and are internal.
-   The opportunities are correctly analyzed from the case study and are external.
-   The threats are correctly analyzed from the case study and are external.
-   Provide an overall evaluation of the organization based on the SWOT analysis.
-   Writing is clear. Used appropriate grammar and writing to express ideas. References were cited properly.

## My Work
From our "Athlete's Warehouse" case study, Colin and Ed Power were discussing whether or not they should open a quality sports shoes and clothing business, if yes, where it should be located. To help a company formulate its strategy, the owner or manager should conduct SWOT analysis to assess internal characteristics of the organization and the external market conditions. The objective of conducting SWOT is to identify strengths and leverage them to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate threats,  while the downside consequences of weaknesses are minimized or manged (Carpenter et al., 2010, p. 227). 

In SWOT analysis, strength is the things that a business idea does well and considered as a source of competitive advantage. For example in our case study, the first strength lies in Colin's and Ed's outstanding knowledge, education, and experience in sports which they can turn into a unique strength that is hard to imitate by others—providing expert assistance with the selection of the goods. This can be very beneficial for building trust and credibility between customers and the business. Second, Colin has experience in high level executive management work which will be handy for the shop's operation. Third, Colin has found great location for the two shops. The location is surrounded by downtown area with many businesses still running, the Exploits Valley Mall with 30 stores and the anchor stores being Woolworths and Dominion, and Cromer Avenue where they were a number of retail operations including Canadian Tire, McDonald's and Cohen's Home Furnishings (Howse, 1992). It's basically in the center of activities, which is potential for the business sale. 

Apart from the strength, there is another internal appraisal known as the weakness, which indicates what the company does less well. Within our study case, the first weakness is that the business proposal will rely only on one source for investment capital from Ed's retirement fund, which makes it less likely to pull through because Ed will have to take a very huge risk in losing all his retirement fund if he choose to invest in starting up the business.  Second, Colin was not employed meaning he didn't have any income which adds pressure for him to try to make sure the business idea pull through. 

Along with the internal appraisal aspects of the company, we now can look at its external appraisal, opportunities. It allows us to see the external attractive factors that represent the reason for the business idea to exist an prosper (Carpenter, 2010, p. 228). First, Colin found out that 36% of the population was age 15 to 34 which fits perfectly into the target group he came up with for sport wears and clothing products. This 35% is equivalent to around 18,000 prospects. Based on experience and estimates of pedestrian traffic Colin further estimated that about 3,000 of the prospects would become customers at shop location, which can projected for first year sales at between $120,000 to $150,000. Second, Colin learned that his potential main competitors either don't have a large selection of athletic shoes and clothing or lack of staff with expert assistance with the selection of the goods. This can allow his business's unique point—providing expert assistance to customers—to standout. Third, Grand Falls the location where his shops were going to locate was ranked fifth highest of the towns in term of average family income meaning the people there were well off and more than capable of purchasing his products. 

Last but not least, it's the threat which include factors beyond our control that could place the strategy, or the business at risk (Carpenter, 2010, p. 228). First, B & B Sports is a threat to Colin's business because they have been in operation for well over 15 years and had been the only sports store in town till 1983 (Howse, 1992). This mean they must have established a number of loyal customers throughout those years. Second, Sports Experts is another threat because they offered a full line of sporting equipment. Third, Sportstop is a probably the greatest threat because it has just opened by a local businessperson, and it offered a variety of goods similar to that proposed by Athlete's Warehouse. 

In conclusion, Colin did a good job when it comes to conducting SWOT analysis by using his one of his strengths—outstanding knowledge, education, and experience in sports—to create uniqueness for his business. He also use this uniqueness as an advantage over his competitors whom he found out to be incapable of offering expert assistance with the selection of athletic shoes and clothing.

**Personal Staging and Pacing**
What sequence of events does my strategy require?
- First, I need to get a scholarship to finish my bachelor degree at McGill university. Second, I will have a business model and plan. Third, I need to raise fund and start my own business start-up.

**Part 2:** 

For the feedback I have received from last week, I think that they were fair, honest, and accurate due to the nature of the platform we have at UoPeople. I only took away what I think would benefit me and reject what I think are not constructive. So far, I haven't had any bad experience from the peer assessment. I actually find it interesting to hear what different people are thinking about my work. 

In term of what I can do to improve the feedback that I give out, I think most importantly is for me to allocate enough time to spend on reading my classmate's work and to really try my best to understand what he/she is trying to say and what could be his/her thinking process before I come to conclusion and give my comment. Apart from that, I think I am happy with what I have been doing so far.
