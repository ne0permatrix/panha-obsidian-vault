# Introduction
We will begin our last unit of the course with a chapter reading on organizational culture. Organizational culture refers to a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs that show people what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Why is organizational culture so important for an organization? What dimensions make up an organization's culture? Finally, who is responsible for the creation and maintenance of an organization's culture? Consider these questions as you read the chapter.

## My Work
From your own observations, give an example of a company’s culture being a strength or a weakness. In what ways was it a strength or weakness?

I used to work for a company in agriculture field in particular natural agriculture. The founder of the company were trying to building a culture which he believed would encourage employees to run every project at a very fast pace. He carried this culture from his other company which is in a different industry, a technology company. His attempt to build the same culture in agriculture field led to many failed projects because in farming we can't just come up with an idea and then jump into doing it straight away without initial research or study. In the technology world in particular a computer programming world, if you didn't research enough and fail a 100 lines of code, the worth consequence that could happen would be that you crash your laptop. However, in farming if your 100 rows of fruit tree were damaged, you would lose a lot money, time, and resources. 

The company didn't believe in a written and thoroughly designed policies on how to start the project, implement it, and evaluate it. Basically, the company was run based on the founder's instinct of what he thinks is right.   Thus, in terms of the artifact, it was hard to notice a particular policies, set of rules or regulations, or specific events. However, what I could notice was that he would constantly push project managers to come up with a quick one week plan, start implementing the project right away, and produce a measurable result. He often time rewarded those who could do that regardless of how acceptable the result was. Many projects that were finished quick ended up being abandoned and wasteful. 


# Learning Journal

The text presents five signs of organizational culture: mission statement, stories & language, physical layout, rules & policies, and rituals. Select an organization where you have worked or are familiar with and identify an example of each sign of organizational culture. How do you think each of these things conveyed the organizational culture to employees and customers/clients.

Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 500 words.


## My Work

Organizational culture shapes how members of a company think, act, behave, and interact with another; therefore, we can learn about its culture by observing employees or interviewing them (Carpenter, 2010, p. 397). There are five signs in which culture shows itself. 

First is the mission statement. "A mission statement that is taken seriously and widely communicated may provide insights into the corporate culture" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 399). At my former workplace, the mission of the company is "To live sustainably and leave minimal footprint on earth". Through this mission statement, we can see that this company values the environment, nature, and well-being of our planet. This mission is widely communicated to everyone within the company since their first day at work. 

The founder himself has a lot of influence on new comers. He does it by telling his adventure stories of traveling the world on a bicycle, camping in the forest, and running across provinces. These stories are very powerful in helping the company conveying their values to everyone within the company. 

What my former company values can also be seen through its physical layout in term of the workspace set up, the material used, and so on. If you visit the office, you will see trees and plants everywhere. On the wall you might have noticed painting of the earth and environmental activist or scientists around the world along with their inspirational quotes. Sitting on the chairs and staring at all the furniture, you might wonder why they look very classic and old. That's because they are made off recycled materials. Moreover, you might have not noticed a single motorbike or car within the organization and questioned yourself, "How does everyone get to work?" You won't be surprised if you head back to the space behind company where you'll find many bicycles hanged on the wall, trees, and bicycle rack. From all these physical signs, you can tell what type of culture the company is embracing. 

Physical facilities or set-ups are built and put in place to support and encourage the implementation of certain rules & policies within the company. For example, employees aren't allowed to bring single-use plastic to the company; therefore, you can see water filters strategically placed throughout the office space. Also, the company has a policies that every single employee is responsible for sorting out their own garbage. That's what all those color-painted trash bins with different signs for. To take an effort even further, the company has a policy that if anyone is late for a meeting they will be punished by committing themselves to plant a certain amount of tree in according to the number of minute they show up late. 

To help their employee connect back with nature, as part of the company's ritual,  we would have to join our annual company's retreat at a natural resort or forest community in the country. During the retreat, there are different activities ranging from team building games to adventure hunt in the forest. These activities strengthen team spirit, bring every closer to each other, and teach them survival skills. One of my favorite activity would have to be the sharing section at night time where forest ranger or indigenous elder are invited to share their stories. Their stories inspire everyone of us and let us know that planet earth is our only home; therefore, we better take a good care of it.
