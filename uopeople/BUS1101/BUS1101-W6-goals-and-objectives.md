# Introduction
Goal setting and planning can lead to significant change within an organization. Creating strong, measurable goals with aligned objectives and strategies can significantly increase an organization’s chance of success. Some guidelines for goal creation include:

-   Involving key stakeholders in the goal- and objective-setting process.
-   Ensuring that all goals and objectives reflect your individual and organizational values, and making it clear why they are critical to success.
-   Aligning goals with your strategy.
-   Making sure your resource allocation is aligned with your goals and priorities.
-   Resisting “over-goaling”—prioritizing your goals and agree to focus your resources on the most important goals at one time.
-   Writing down your goals and objectives—leaving no room for ambiguity.

In this unit, you will learn about how to set goals and objectives and then relate them to the overall strategy.

## My Work
In what ways do goals and objectives help managers control various processes within an organization?

"Goals and objectives can provide a form of control since they create a feedback opportunity regarding how well or how poorly the organization executes its strategy" (Carpenter, 2010). Goals and objectives help manager gauge, report, and improve performance.  They also help managers align effort and manage accountabilities of all the employees. 

How do specific and measurable goals affect employee and promote organizational performance?

To set goal effectively, we need establish a sense of clarity, and measurable goals help employees increase their chance of achieving what they set out to achieve at work and in life. "Without measurement, you cannot tell where you have been, where you are now, or if you are heading in the direction you are intending to go" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 287). Setting measurable goals aid employees to assess their progress accurately while giving them a sense of accomplishment when they achieve their goals. This motivates them to keep on doing the good work.  

Provide an example from your own experience of when a specific goal or objective provided beneficial control over a process.

I used to work for company who was building up a team to work on a reforestation project in Cambodia on a 78-hectare piece of land. I was responsible for co-organizing a tree-planting event with one of our partners. Our partner wanted to plant 2000 trees on my company's property. Therefore, we had to set a specific goal to prepare 2 hectares of land for event. Based on this goal, we than narrowed down to several objectives. First, we needed to hire 7 villagers to help clear the grass. Second, two big water tank need to be filled with water from near by water source and brought to the planting location. Third, all the 2000 trees have to be brought from the bottom of the hill to the top where the tree planting land is. 

Explain what the beneficial control was and how did it positively impact organizational performance.

When we set specific goal and objectives, we got things mostly under our control. We effectively delegated responsibilities and tasks to each team members. Everyone knew what we were trying to achieve as our end result. Their efforts were channeled toward the same direction/purpose.  They knew what they were hold accountable for. All these ingredients led us to successfully co-organize a tree-planting event. Even after the event, having set specific goals and objectives for our team help me as a project manager to clearly and accurately evaluate every single one of our members on what they did well and what they needed to improve so that I can give them feedback and acknowledgment. As for our company,

I believe that for farmers can live a fulfilling life full joy and pride by farming in harmony with nature. My personal vision and mission is to awaken people to farm harmoniously with nature by educating both farmers and consumers the benefit of regenerative agriculture for humanity and the planet; conducting localized research on regenerative farming methods and their impact; and investing in farmers to transit into regenerative farming through our incubation program. 

I believe that my goals and objectives above will bring me closer to realizing my vision and mission. I learned that the whole process of setting vision and mission, coming up with a strategy, and brainstorming goals and objectives is simply a process to break the vision and mission down to small achievable goals and objectives.
