# Introduction

The workplace can be a major source of anger, distress, frustration, and embarrassment, but also a spring of pride, belongingness, fulfillment, and excitement. These emotions derive both from work-related events and interactions, as well as from the non-work feelings that employees bring with them to the job. The consequences of these states are far-reaching, impacting not only well-being outcomes but also individual, group and organizational performance. In this unit, we will explore the attitudes and behaviors of people at work.

# Discussion Assignment

The text defines personality as “a person’s relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns” while values are “stable life goals, reflecting what is most important to them.” Pick one of the “Big Five Personality Traits” (see figure 2.5) that details the most important trait for your current job or a position you want to eventual be in. Describe why this is the most important. Give an example of how this personality trait aligns with one of your professional goals.

## My Work
Out of the big five personality traits, I think that "openness" is the most important trait for my current job. "Openness is the degree to which a person is curious, original, intellectual, creative, and open to new ideas" (Carpenter et al., 2010). As I am now exploring a new field of work, agriculture, I find the ability to stay curious and open-minded to acquire new information and creatively internalize them to solve
problems very crucial. Without the openness, it will be hard for me to gather complete information and look at an issue from different angles. Inability to do so might will not lead me to the real problem and its root causes, which could result in a failure to eliminate or solve that particular problem itself. 

In addition, as my field of work is resolved around working with different sectors including the government, NGOs, private sectors, and farmers, I need to remain open-minded and not judgmental to really hear them out. This technique will greatly help me gather useful information, complain, and concern. Eventually, with this knowledge and information I believe that I can creatively come up with a social business plan to help tackle the issues.

# Written Assignment

Read the mini-case study in section 2.1. “Case in Point: SAS Institute Invests in Employees.” The study generally discusses the approach of a major software company to its employees. Then, consider the “Factors That Have the Strongest Influence over Work Behaviors” from figure 2.15. Describe how each of the four factors is managed by SAS. Do you agree or disagree with the firm’s approach and policies? Why or why not?

# Learning Journal
As noted in this week’s textbook chapter, employees are happier when they received regular feedback (Carpenter, Bauer, & Erdogan, 2010, p.97). Feedback takes many forms, but one of the most obvious types is feedback on performance. Managers must be able to give employees feedback on what they are doing well, and areas where an employee needs to improve. Think about times in your career when you have received feedback, and write a response that includes the following:

1.  Share an example of a time when you received effective feedback that helped you improve your performance. What made that feedback helpful? 
2.  Share an example of a time when you received feedback that was not helpful. What made that feedback ineffective? 
3.  Using your two examples, what can you conclude about the characteristics of effective feedback? If you were a manager, how could you use these lessons to improve the feedback you gave?
    
Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 500 words.
## My Work
1.  Share an example of a time when you received effective feedback that helped you improve your performance. What made that feedback helpful? 

I possess a proactive personality trait meaning I don't wait for people to tell me what to do, but I take initiative to solve problems, to fix what's wrong, to remove obstacles, and to improve myself (Carpenter, Bauer, & Erdogan, 2010, p.78) . I am very self-aware and capable of giving myself an honest assessment after each time I make a mistake. Considering myself as quite an open-minded person, I would listen to people criticism and feedback first without rejecting them from the start. For most of the time, I am also self-driven, and I know how to push myself forward. I live by a mindset, "Don't be afraid to make mistakes, but make sure you don't repeat your mistakes." In my life, I take risks to explore and learn from mistake. My attitude to life is to reach my full potential by constantly challenging and improving myself every single day. Because of my personality, mindset, and attitude to life, negative harsh criticism or feedback doesn't really work with me.  

Back in high school I was in a basketball team. I had a coach who would punish me when I did something wrong in training or during the game. I think punishing bad habit or behavior has its own place in training or in life itself. However, my coach didn't really just punish me, but he gave me a sense of judgment and discrimination. Within out basketball team, there were players who were good, picked up new moves or drills faster than others, or were more composed under pressure or within a competition. Those were the ones whom my coach tended to spend more time with on the court and off the court. The rest who were not really good, or were slow to catch up with the team including me would did not get the attention. I felt like we were in a different world full of losers. I remember at one point in a game, my coach just pulled me off the court and put me on the bench because I made a mistake or something. Until now I don't know what I did wrong, but I only remember that I was ashamed and humiliated in front of so many people. His action affected my sense of pride, my sense of importance, and damaged my self-esteem. What even worse is that he didn't really get to effectively show me what I did wrong. I call that ineffective coaching or feedback. 

I am a big believer of positive feedback. It works very well with me because of my proactive personality trait. Harsh or violent criticism is not going to do me any good, but encouragement and positive accurate feedback would. For example, I used to be racing on a road bicycle for Cambodian national team and be trained by a former world-class professional road cyclist from England. It was an online training program somewhat similar to my experience with University of the People now. He gave me weekly training program through an online platform where there was specific training instruction, objectives, and assessment. Each day I went out on my bike for training, recorded my training in my bicycle computer, and uploaded all the training data on to the platform for my coach to analyze and give feedback. He mostly started the feedback with what I did right or well and would add on top of that anything he thought I could have done better or improve in my next training. This method of give feedback works well with me. It doesn't hurt my self-esteem, but it sends me a message that I am on the right track and making mistakes is just part of the process. With that message, I went out to smash my next training and improved.

In conclusion, I think we all respond to feedback differently depending on our personality traits, how we perceive ourselves, how we feel about our self-worth, and what stage in life we are at. From a manager's position, I think it is important to learn about what type of person our employee is or what personality trait they possess in order to effectively give them feedback on their performance without them as a negative judgment on their self-worth because in the end we just want the best for our company and also the best for each other. We don't want to ruin anyone's self-esteem.
