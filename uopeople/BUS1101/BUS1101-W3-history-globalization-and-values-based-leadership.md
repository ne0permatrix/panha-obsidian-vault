# Introduction

The more complex an organization and its operations, the more active a role management must play in its operation. Successful management establishes a degree of order and discipline so that work can be accomplished expeditiously, no matter what the size of the organization, how many countries it operates in, or how much of its work is performed virtually.

In this unit, you will explore various theories of management throughout history, paying close attention to Frederick Winslow Taylor's scientific management theory, which was widely practiced in the industrial age of the 20th century. You will also take stock of more contemporary, 21st-century approaches to management, which tend to be better suited to organizations in knowledge-based industries (as opposed to those in manufacturing). Finally, you will begin to examine management from a global perspective.

Additionally, this week you will peer assess your first Written Assignment and give anonymous feedback to three of your peers. Giving feedback is a core managerial skill, as you will often give feedback to your employees. Even if you are not a manager in charge of other employees, you will still need to give feedback to your boss and your peers. Like many managerial skills, giving feedback takes practice and good communication skills. Good feedback needs to be honest, but also kindly delivered. As you peer assess this week, look for both the strengths and the weaknesses in the assignments you read. Be sure to let your peer know the areas they can improve, but point out the areas they did well, too.

# Discussion Assignment
Frederic Taylor applied the scientific method to management. In many cases, this meant measuring a process to determine its optimal possible output. From your own work experience, discuss a time you have seen measurements used to manage a process. Examples might include allowing a certain amount of time for a phone call or a project deadline. Do you believe the results were optimal, based on the measurement used?

Please answer in 150 words or more. Use your own words - please do not copy and paste from a website. Be sure to reference your sources.

### My Work
From early management before the 90s, the workforce was more of a laborious or physical type. Employees were less educated and required to involve in manual labor tasks instead of knowledge work. Thus, one way to keep track of their productivity was to observe and analyze their time and motion when they performed a certain task. Frederick Winslow Taylor developed and formalized the principles of scientific management (Carpenter et el., 2010, p. 129). "Taylor is most famous for his “time studies,” in which he used a stopwatch to time how long it took a worker to perform a task, such as shoveling coal or moving heavy loads" (Carpenter et el., 2010, p. 129). What has scientific management been applied for in my past work experience?  
  
In 2020, I used to work on a farm. In its first stage of development, I had to help with some labor work; for example, carrying rocks in a wheel barrel for construction usage. In the beginning, I wasn't aware of how heavy a wheel barrel full of rock was. I tried to load the wheel barrel with as much rock as I could hoping to finish the work quickly. However, the result turned out different than what I expected. The wheel barrel collapsed a couple of times along the way because it was hard to maneuver on bumpy terrain. As a result, I had to spend more time, put in all my effort, and exerted all my energy to drag it to the destination.  
  
After I had carried a couple of rounds, I accidentally put less rock at one time, about one-third less than the weight of each previous wheel barrel. I noticed that the maneuver felt much easier. So did the effort. I was not completely exhausted at the end of each round. Logically, I thought to myself, "This could be a more efficient way to transport those rocks for me because it fits my body type better as I am more of a lean and endurance person rather than a bulky strong guy. Therefore, constant moderate power exertion works better than a spiky maximal power exertion for me."  
  
Unfortunately, I didn't really weigh the loaded wheel barrel properly and record the time it took me to transport those rocks to the destination at different weight loads. In conclusion, I can't scientifically prove that after I applied scientific management to my rock transportation, I could find the optimal weight, or I could increase the productivity of my task.

### My Work
Who have not heard of Coca-Cola? Coca-Cola brand has embedded in many cultures around the globe. "Today, Coca-Cola is one of most recognizable brands in the world" ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 1). It continues to grow in recent year by capitalizing on the rapidly expanding global beverage industry ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 1). According to "Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", it now operates in over 200 countries with over 84,000 suppliers (n.d., p. 1). Along with all the success and rapid growth, The Coca-Cola company still had to go through some global challenge trends and creatively figure out solution to tackle them. The following writing will discuss a challenge trend, a solution trend, and a building block of learning organization that the Coca-Cola company has experienced. 

In respond to one of 5 challenge trends, greater personalization and customization, the Coca-Cola company developed a strategy called "product differentiation", which helped them to successfully expand their product globally and satisfy their global market segment.  "Another key factor that has supported Coca-Cola’s globalized vision has been the company’s ability to customize its product line to meet the needs of individual consumer markets" ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 3). For example, they developed like Powerade, other energy drinks, and flavored Coke—Cherry Coke and Vanilla Coke—to attract youths, while creating Diet Coke for health conscious older consumers ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 3). Moreover, they even take it to another level with their packaging by developing and using packaging materials that can be recycled and are sustainable for the environment in order to meet their environmentally friendly market segment.

Despite all the challenges, the Coca-Cola company creatively and innovatively push their global marketing strategies to the top which aligns with one of the five solution trend, rise of creative class. Marketing Strategies played a very significant role in successfully globalizing the company ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 2).  With all the social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and blogs, anyone can demonstrate their artwork to the world and reach millions of audiences (Carpenter et el., 2010, p. 145). The Coca-Cola company took advantage of this by deploying two successful marketing strategies. First, they use advertising slogans and catchy jingles. Second, they sign commercial sponsorship contract with Olympic Games and many more sport events ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., pp. 2-3). These strategies help them expand their market segment even broader globally. 

I think that all these successful campaigns and strategies as a result of many ideas the Coca-Cola company have came up with and many experiment they have conducted, but one of the most critical building blocks would have to be the systematic problem solving that they has established which categorizes them as a learning organization. To solve problems and make important decisions, they always want to take the scientific, well-researched, and data-driven approaches. "Coca-Cola has invested significant time and money into researching and understanding different marketing trends and consumer segments based on lifestyle, age, and income in order to accurately develop and market its products" ("Globalization and The Coca-Cola Company", n.d., p. 3). 
This kind of principle helps them increase their chance of success and allows them to capitalize on the challenge and solution trend they had. 

In conclusion, even though the Coca-Cola company had to also go through the global trend of greater personalization and customization, they creatively came with strategies to help them adapt, evolve, and still thrive around the globe. One of their remarkable innovations is their global marketing strategy which falls in one of the five global strategy trends, the rise of creative class. What we can learn from them regarding their journey to successfully overcome these challenges is their development of systematic problem solving approach which allows them to consistently solve problems using data, statistical tools, and scientific research.

### Early Management Principles

### Fayol's 14 Principles of Management 

### Time and Motion
-	Frederick Winslow Taylow (**Taylorism**)
-	Frank Gilbert and Lillian Moller Gilberth

### Limitations of the Early Views
- Early views only worked with labor-intensive work. However, modern workforce has evolved toward knowledge-based work.

> "For example, **a manager** may engage in hiring, training, and scheduling employees to accomplish work in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.  A manager is considered a failure if he or she is not able to complete the project or goals with efficiency or when the cost becomes too high" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 131).

> "However, **a leader** within a company develops individuals to complete predetermined goals and projects. A leader develops relationships with his or her employees by building communication, by evoking images of success, and by eliciting loyalty" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 131)

### Management Ideas of the 1990s
- **Peter Drucker**
- **Tom Peters and Robert Waterman**
	- Nine Principles of Management
- **Warren Bennis**
	- > "More than just a manager, an effective leader was defined as someone with the ability to influence and motivate others not only to perform work tasks but also to support the organization’s values and meet the organization’s goals. Different views of leadership through the ages are shown next" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 132)

![[Pasted image 20210921085554.png]]

### Increase Concern for the Environment
- What does this mean in your own word?
	- Now more people become more aware of environmental issues and want to help meaning companies can't just focus on profit anymore. Managers need to do his work to achieve the triple bottom line. 
		- >  "Companies realize they have to take bold steps to minimize their carbon footprint, create environmentally friendly products, and manage the company for more than just the next quarter’s profits" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 142).
- **Triple Bottom Line**
	- Profit
	- Employee
	- Environment
- >  "Managers can’t simply “greenwash” (pretend to be green through tiny steps and heavy advertising)" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 142).
 ### Greater Personalization and Customization
 - What does it mean in your own word?
	 - Now customers want personalized and customized products meaning there are more variants of product in the market and more work for a manager. 
		 - "Customization and the growing numbers of products mean managing more services and more products" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 143).
 ### Faster Pace of Innovation
 - What does it mean in your own word?
	 - Customers want new product, and want it fast. Companies have to adapt to this fast pace to build and release the product. One way to do that is to do something first to find out if it works or not and always try to choose the fastest path. 
		 - > “We set an operational tempo: when in doubt, do something,” Glazer said, “If you have two paths and you’re not sure which is right, take the fastest path.”Fast company. (2008, March). Retrieved January 28, 2009, from http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/123/google.html.
 ### Increasing Complexity
 - What does it mean in your own words?
	 - Because of more environmental awareness, more customization, more innovation, company faces more complexity meaning managers have to be able to deal with complex tasks. 
 ### Increasing Competition for Talent
