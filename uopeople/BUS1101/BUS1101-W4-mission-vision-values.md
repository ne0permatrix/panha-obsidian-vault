# Introduction
An important key to any successful journey is to start with the end in mind. This is true whether the journey is something like a carefully planned vacation or like the initiation of a new business enterprise or restructuring of an existing business. A vision is the concept of what the firm really wants to be. It captures the imagination of the company and provides a focus for efforts. A firm’s mission describes what the business does and what customers it serves. A mission is more specific than a vision in that it establishes the guidelines of how the business fulfills its vision. The information and worksheets in this publication will help you build and maintain a vision for your business.

Most vision statements include some aspects of three important elements: a core ideology, an envisioned future, and recognition of service to stakeholders. The core ideology of the vision statement contains a statement about the firm’s values and “reason for being.” The envisioned future is a statement that describes what the firm will be like if it achieves its most important goals.

Additionally, this week you will have the opportunity to read feedback from your peers on your Unit 2 Written Assignment. Last week we talked about how important it is to be able to give feedback, but it is equally important to receive feedback. Regardless of your career path, you will receive feedback on your work and your ideas throughout your career – from your boss, from your peers, from your employees, from your clients, and from your customers. It is not always easy to receive feedback, but using feedback effectively can help you advance in your career. As you read the feedback your peers left on your Written Assignment, remember to approach it with an open mind and assume that the author is trying to help you improve your work. As you write your Written Assignment this week, how can you use the feedback you received to improve your work?

# Discussion Assignment
The text defines stakeholders as: “Individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the organization or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected as a result of what the organization does.” Every organization has stakeholders. Choose one of the companies below and identify three key stakeholders. Then discuss how the company caters for their interests and what may happen if their expectations are not met.

-   A water utility company
-   A multinational food company
-   A local airport

Please answer in 150 words or more. Use your own words - please do not copy and paste from a website. Be sure to reference your sources. Then, engage in a dialogue with your classmates on the above question and any other perspectives you have on the above topics. You are expected to make at least three response posts to the discussion board during the course of the discussion period and rate your classmates’ posts. Don’t forget to rate the postings of your classmates according to the Rating Guidelines. Review the Discussion Forum rating guidelines to see how your classmates will be rating your post.

## My Work
I choose a local airport. The three key stakeholders within this organization are (1) capital market stakeholder—the owners, shareholders, investors— (2) the social stakeholder—the government or State Secretariat of Civil Aviation—and the organizational stakeholder—the manager and employee. Because this kind of business require huge capital to begin with for building the airport and infrastructure, buying planes, and getting license, it needs shareholders and investors. Without this group of stakeholder, the airport business will not exist. Moreover, the social stakeholder like the government or State Secretariat of Civil Aviation plays a crucial role in allowing or approving the airport business to come through, because it involves system that could threaten people's lives and nations' airspace security. Last but not least, this airport business requires organizational stakeholder like managers, pilots, fly-attendants, technicians and so on to keep the airport operating. 
# Written Assignment
The written assignment for unit 4 is slightly unique.  You need to upload the SCAMPER creativity tool then give examples with explanations.  However, the SCAMPER creativity tool is actually a table.  

The text discusses the SCAMPER creativity tool. After reviewing this in the text, complete the following chart with examples not found in the text. In the explanation column briefly explain how the example relates to the question.  

Since the SCAMPER creativity tool is a table, the body of your assignment needs to 

-   introduce your table (including a table number) in a paragraph then 
-   list your table with a table number, table title, and note per the 7th edition of the APA. 

Don’t forget to properly cite and reference your sources per the 7th edition of the APA, including where you obtained the SCAMPER creativity tool.

Download this [SCAMPER Creativity Tool](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1402435/mod_book/chapter/293733/BUS1101_unit_4_written_assignment_template%20-%20Updated.doc) that contains the Chart below.

-   The chart contains accurate examples for each of the 8 questions.
-   The chart contains accurate explanations for each of the 8 questions.
-   Writing is clear. Used appropriate grammar and writing to express ideas. References (if used) were cited properly.
