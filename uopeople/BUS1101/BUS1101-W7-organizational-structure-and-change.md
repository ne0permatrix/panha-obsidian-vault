# Introduction
Change is a difficult process for many organizations. When two companies merge, for example, it can take a couple of years to reorganize and many more years before the two respective cultures truly merge. This transition process can be especially challenging if the cultures are very different. The most difficult aspect of managing change is implementing it in the first place. Humans are naturally resistant to change; making changes in an organization is no exception. Nevertheless, external forces may require change; the organization must be able to adapt.

## My Work

There is a global shift from a materialistic and consumerist lifestyle to a more sustainable and minimalist one. People begin to care and concern more about the ecological well being of the earth and advocate for a more greener business or economics. "The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that the value of sustainability-related investment instruments (such as green bonds) reached between $1.2 trillion and $1.3 trillion in 2019, signaling that there are opportunities for firms to capitalize on the push for sustainable growth" (Qiang et el., 2021). My former boss saw this trend and noticed this change in market condition. 

Thus, he wanted to grab the opportunity to get more potential investment capital  for further expanding his company. As a result, he invested in buying 100-hectare land to begin building an eco-friendly community as a step toward green business. This new strategy forced certain changes in company's culture and policy. 

For example, all company's employees, community members, long-term and short-term guests, and visitors are not allowed to play loud amplified music, drink alcohols, smoke, or bring in any plastic onto company's property. The implementation of these changes were critical and quick not allowing enough time for guests, visitors, and especially company's employees to adjust, which resulted in high turnover rate. 

This is not a simple matter. This particular change in company culture and policy is related to employees' habits, ways of life, and personal values. Complying to these organizational changes means changing their on habits and lives, which requires time and a lot of communication to be effective. 

Unfortunately, many employees were put in a passive resistance mode meaning they didn't speak up even though they didn't completely support the new culture or policy. They ended up becoming quiet and holding all these disagreements within themselves which led to them being unhappy, feeling stress, and looking for a way out of the company.

## My Work
-   What is a challenge to reporting to more than one manager in a matrix organization? What might be a benefit?

The main challenge to reporting to more than one manager or leader in matrix organization is conflict (Carpenter, 2010). At the management level, conflict could manifest in a form of power struggle among managers. For example, a close relationship or respect that an employee has built with a particular manager could result in the decrease in power of other managers. Imagine two different managers have their own preference of how to get a particular task done and want employee to follow their way only. If the employees follow a particular manager, what does that mean to the other manager in term of power? 

Moreover, because matrix organization embraces employees with different backgrounds coming together to work under the same project, there could be an interpersonal conflict where one person might intefere with another person's attempt to achieving goals or completing an assignment. Due to different perspectives, attitudes, needs or behaviors of team members who have different backgrounds, a project could possibly experiences task conflict where each employee prefers to perform a particular task differently. It doesn't end here. Multiple leaders within a team might assign an employee to do different roles which as a consequence making that employee confused, overwhelmed, and vulnerable to poor performance. That's an example of a role conflict.  

On the bright side, matrix organization keeps employees focused on the making of a particular product or service which fastens and improves the operation process because project members can now have quick response to technical problems or customer demand from their direct project manager. On top of this, communication between departments and among employees can also be increased and improved due to project manager's constant effort to get the project going. 

-   What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of being employed by a boundary-less organization?
Being employed by a boundary-less organization allows employee to get a diverse work exposure to different industries, companies, human resources, and cultures because of the collaboration effort and outsourcing process of their company. It gives them a great opportunity to learn various things and grow. At the same time, in a boundary-less organization employees can feel closer to one another because their work cross path with one another, and their workplace don't really have the physical barrier, wall for different departments. 

-   What is the main cost of maintaining an organizational learning environment? What is the greatest benefit?
The greatest benefit for learning organization is that they keep on reaching high standard by experimenting, testing, learning new things, reflecting on the new gained knowledge, and internalizing them to create organizational changes for the company. On the other hand, along with the experiments and testing, there comes mistakes and failures meaning company has to spend time, energy, effort, human resource, material resource, and financial resource to keep those learning going. 

-   Which kind of organization would you like to work for? Why?
I think to advice an organization to stick to just a particular type of organizational structure is not an appealing option. I would say that a competent manager should know their company's nature or current situation well; have the knowledge of all these different forms of organizational structure, how and when to use them; and take advantage of them by applying them within their organization based on their exact circumstances.

## Great Assignment Example 
In this written assignment I will look at some organizational structures and consider some aspects of each type of structure.  In short, I will discuss matrix organizations, boundaryless organizations, and learning organizations, and explain some strong points and weak points of each type of structure.  I will also discuss which organization structure would work the best for me.

In matrix organizations, employees must report to both department managers and project or product managers.  The challenges of this type of structure includes the possibility of conflict between department managers and product managers, and the different managers may compete with one another for control over employees.  Employees may receive different, uncoordinated instructions from each manager, or they may become overwhelmed because of too many instructions given.  The benefits of this type of structure include increased communication within the organization, especially between different departments.   Since product/project managers are also used, the benefit is that issues relating to the product or customers can be quickly resolved (Carpenter et al., 2010).

A boundaryless organization is an organization that seeks to destroy any boundaries within and even outside the organization.  This can be done by cooperating more with other organizations in a process called outsourcing.  Other examples are the elimination of the managerial role in the organization and the absence of separation between the different departments (Carpenter et al., 2010).  One benefit of working at a boundaryless organization is the increased communication when different departments are not separated.  Another benefit is a more responsible attitude to the entirety of the company’s needs.  When employees are less restricted in their job descriptions, they may adapt to different situations without shrugging the responsibility off onto someone else (Carpenter et al., 2010).  This may help to increase the quality of the end-product of service. 

On the other hand, boundaryless organizations may come with challenges.  Some of these include an increased workload because of less defined job descriptions.  Since there are no walls between the different departments, there is also the possibility of increased disturbance in the office.  This may lead to decreased productivity and may affect employee happiness.

In learning organizations, the emphasis is on acquiring knowledge, experimentation, and learning from mistakes (Carpenter et al., 2010).  The most important cost associated with this may be the act of stepping out of the comfort zone.  As we all know, learning is a painful, effort-requiring procedure.  Therefore, to foster a learning environment, employees and managers alike will have to be prepared to set aside their comfortable little habits and seek a higher calling.  The positive result of fostering a learning environment is increased innovation, one of the intangible resources of an organization (Carpenter, et al., 2010).

If I had to choose, I would like to work at a boundaryless organization.  The reason for this is that I enjoy it when people take initiative.  It can be frustrating when value gets sacrificed for job description, and I believe I would not enjoy such an atmosphere.  Rather, I would enjoy working at an organization where people are committed to the spirit of their organization, not enslaved to their designated niche. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider the different types of organizational structure with me.  I hope you learned something about matrix organizations, boundaryless organizations, and learning organizations, and that you, too, will be able to work at an organization with a structure that appeals to your personal preference.

# Learning Journal
Reflect on the section _Planning and Executing Change Effectively_, in Chapter 7 of the text. Summarize the key steps in planning and executing change in a 500 word journal entry.

There is a useful frameworks for planning and executing change called Lewin's Three-Stage Process which consists of unfreezing, change, and refreezing (Carpenter, 2010, p. 361). The first part of this three-stage process is called unfreezing which basically refers to a stage where manager need to prepare the employees to be ready and receptive to changes. "Many change efforts fail because people are insufficiently prepared for change" (Carpenter, 2010, p. 362). This suggests to us that we can just implement the change right away. 

We, as a manager, need to let the employee know what is going to happen, when, and why. More importantly, we can't just communicate the plan, but we also need to show them the vision, reasons behind changes, and the importance of the changes. They need to know that the planned changes are critical for the company and supported by top management team. To communicate all these, manager doesn't really have to convince everyone himself. He can identify key influencers or opinion leaders within the company and make sure they understand and support the changes. As organization requires support from the employees to successfully implement changes, they also need support from the managers to feel like their needs are not ignored. 

Change is the second part of the Lewin's Three-Stage Process. It emphasizes on the actual execution of the planned changes. With new changes, new roles and responsibilities, some employees might struggle and stress out. It's important that managers still continue to support them by displaying support and patience. Together with that, manager should break the big changes down to small specific goals so that everyone can see the actual progress especially impact that the changes have which could motivate them to continue to change. As the changes are being implemented, obstacles could crop up along the way, it's manager's job to identify them, diagnose them, and get rid of them. 

The final stage of Lewin's Three-Stage Process is the refreezing stage. Successful changes should become a part of company's culture. To help the change permanently become a part of the company's culture, manager can announce concrete result of the implementation to everyone within the company. This way it could help employees gain confidence that their decision to support and implement the changes are right. Furthermore, positive reinforcement toward wanted actions could strengthen the possibility that the change will stay permanently within the organization. The reward system doesn't have to be financial. Simple act of giving the acknowledgment and appreciation toward wanted action of an employee in front of their peers would already work. This type of action from the managers will encourage others to get on board with the change. On top of all that, implementing organizational change doesn't have to be a one-episode-stop effort. The world keeps changing. So do many aspects of an organization. Therefore, learning organization can be used to embrace continuous changes, where dynamic feed back loop is created to identify necessary changes, figure out new effective practices, and put them into the execution list. This can help an organization to constantly improve and reach higher standards.
