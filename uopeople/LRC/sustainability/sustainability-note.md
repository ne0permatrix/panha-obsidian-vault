We often hear the words '**sustainable**' and '**sustainability**' in our daily lives. But what does sustainability mean? You have come to the right place. This tutorial explores the relationship between the environment and the activities undertaken by humans to meet their own needs.

The sustainability concept seeks to advocate for equitable resource distribution, both across populations and across time, while being careful to preserve the natural environment. The perspectives consider the ways in which human well being can be achieved together with environmental conservation, and how these ideas intersect with societal experiences such as those surrounding poverty and social justice.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn some of the foundational knowledge regarding sustainability.  By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

-   recognizes and interpret sustainability related content.
-   familiarize yourself with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
-   appreciate the moral and ethical reasoning behind the sustainability paradigm.
-   appreciably apply sustainability principles in academic pursuits and everyday life.

# Sustainability Learning Content

## What is Sustainability?

The problems associated with continuous economic growth and development have steadily increased and become more recognizable. Issues such as pollution, natural resource consumption and climate change etc., as well as their consequences, are no longer a mystery. In fact, there are various examples in history where can take cue from the impacts of unrestrained growth and resource exploitation on the integrity of societies.

**Sustainability** is a modern concept that promotes thinking around ways of living in harmony with the natural world, while simultaneously and actively working to protect and preserve it from irreversible damage. It seeks to balance the advancement of human well-being with the conservation of our natural environment. The sustainability drive has led humanity to the era of sustainable development, which relates to the need to address environmental and social problems while we develop technologically and economically.

**Sustainability Explained**

We often hear the words 'sustainable' and 'sustainability' in our daily lives. But what does sustainability mean? Review Explainity's Sustainability Explained video to learn what sustainability means using scenarios from our daily lives. Pay attention to some of the basic changes to lifestyles and systems that can lead to a more sustainable society.

The industrial revolution brought a rapid surge in economic growth, and therefore an increase in resource exploitation and waste production, leading to a significant redistribution of wealth. The environment was treated as an infinite resource which could be plundered without caution, for the creation of wealth for the working class. Things started changing with respect to this view about the environment, following the stimulus effect of Rachel Carson’s 1962 book, Silent Spring, which called attention to the idea of environmental conservation. The link between growth and the environment was progressively more closely researched, leading to the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development report (Brundtland Report), called ‘Our Common Future’, which had a great impact on communicating the need for ‘**sustainable development**’.

The 1987 Brundtland report defines **sustainable development** as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.

This comprehensive description of sustainable development means that all crucial development issues can be conveniently incorporated into sustainability practices. There is a vast array of issues which can be confronted in a bid to safeguard the ability of future generations to supply their needs, and these fall under three main umbrellas: Environment, Society and Economy. These are the three spheres of sustainability.

**Note:** The Brundtland report also catalyzed a series of global actions, including the formulation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015, many of which were not met due to various challenges.

## Why is Sustainability Important?

Sustainability is critical because it offers a pathway to maintaining human well-being on earth, along with that of all biodiversity. Increasing extinction rates, depletion of natural resources, and climate change impacts are some of the unavoidable environmental consequences of neglecting sustainability. Without a reduction in consumption rates, a shift from shareholder profit maximization for businesses, and reorientation of abuse of power to decrease inequalities, more pressure will be placed on our economic and social systems as well.

**Why is Sustainability Important?**

Why Should We Care About Sustainability explains the need for sustainability using the ‘funnel metaphor’. An unsustainable way of life will only place pressure on everyone, leading to less and less room to operate and thrive in a favorable

**Sustainable Development**

In Why Sustainable Development is Important: Happiness and Wellbeing, Jeffrey Sachs, an advisor to the UN Secretary General, describes why the concept of sustainable development is so important, why it is necessary that we orient towards the three objectives of prosperity, social fairness, and environmental sustainability.

Considering the fact that human advancement has been historically tied to progressive environmental degradation, the well-being of a growing population is doomed to breakdown when resources that can be exploited run out. Striving for sustainability in our homes, offices and communities around the world gives us, as well as future generations, a chance at continued survival in a world where resources are finite.

## The Sustainable Development Goals

Following a meeting of the United Nations conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, a collection of goals was developed as an upgrade to the Millennium Development Goals, which had primarily led to a general reduction in world poverty. The new set of goals, 17 in all, were crafted to encourage commitments from all stakeholder groups towards addressing the sustainability challenges we face in a more comprehensive manner.  
  
The new UN sustainability agenda was instituted with the inauguration of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This agenda is intended to be a road map towards eliminating extreme poverty and inequalities while safeguarding environmentally friendly economic growth over a 15-year period. These goals have been better defined than those of the MDGs, and come with targets and indicators for tracking purposes. They form a framework within which policies can be formulated by governments and institutions, towards making sustainability an everyday consideration in every pursuit or decision-making process.

**Getting to Know the SDGs**

In Getting to Know the SDGs, Jeffrey Sachs, director of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, profiles the history of the sustainable development agenda, from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, to the creation and implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, to the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015.

## A Sustainable Future

We cannot accurately forecast a sustainable future, but we are able to predict what tangible gains could be made if we are able to achieve sustainable development goals. Conversely, we can rely on the data we have gathered over the years to appreciate how not meeting sustainability goals would negatively affect the well-being of all life on earth. It is important to develop systems and technologies that can help minimize our environmental footprint, and maximize equalities around the world. We are confident about the prospects because there are several historical references that illustrate how concerted efforts help to combat global challenges. The worldwide drive to promote the healing of the ozone layer through the ban on chlorofluorocarbons was a very successful one because widespread commitments and goals were met. Sustainability obligations and advocacy have the capacity to achieve same.

The university, as a learning institution, is no exception in this journey. It has the duty of aligning its research and education agenda towards the concept of sustainable development. If the process of learning affords students the opportunity to come into contact with SDG-related content, then they would be equipped with the knowledge and skills required to work and live in a sustainable fashion.

There is so much that can be done to make sustainable development a reality. Some of these strategies include resource conservation, protection of biodiversity, energy conservation, using renewable fossil-fuel-free energy, recycling wastes, advocating equal opportunities for all and adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles. Some of these interventions are small, others are huge. With the right knowledge and skills, we can all contribute in small ways that collectively make a significant impact on ensuring desirable long-term development for current and future generations.
