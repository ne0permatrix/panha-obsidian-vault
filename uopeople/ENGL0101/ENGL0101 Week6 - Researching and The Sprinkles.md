Introduction
====

This unit will focus on using the UoPeople Library to find three sources for your 5 paragraph paper. You will assess the sources and learn how to add them to your paper with the correct credit given per APA style format. You will learn about writing with clarity. You will use the Discussion Forum to discuss the story you chose to read for this week.  Your Learning Journal this week will be focused on gathering properly cited sources for your 5 paragraph essay.

This unit also features a Graded Quiz on the subjects from Units 1-6. It is strongly recommended that you take the Self-Quiz before attempting the Graded Quiz.


Discussion Assignment
====

For your Discussion Assignment, you will pick a story that is located in the reading assignment area. You will state, with a quotation from the story you chose, why you decided to write on that particular story. I want you to explain the significance of the quote to you--why did this line from the story stand out to you--and tell your classmates if you recommend the story or not.

Remember, you will need to use:

    One quote formatted using APA in-text citation style.
    The full reference information formatted using APA Reference section style (if you need help with the reference material, you can use Scribber at www.scribber.com but make sure you select APA and not MLA).

You are also responsible for replying with three or four sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

The story I picked is called "The Elephant Vanishes" written by Haruki Murakami. It is about a private investigation conducted by a normal Japanese male citizen, who is very passionate about elephants, on a mysterious local case of a missing old elephant and its keeper. "I had even gone to hear the town council’s debates on the matter, which is why I am able to give such a full and accurate account of the course of events" (Murakami, n.d.). This particular quote from the story stands out to me because it mentions the town council's debates about the missing elephant case and tells how curious and serious a fellow Japanese citizen could be when it comes to investigating about something they passionately love. I really like the idea or practice of letting the governors of a place have a debate about issues their community is facing and opening it to the public to hear. It's a great way for people to know what's going on, see what their leaders' decision process is, analyze their reasoning, and point out their leader's spots. This is what is still missing in my country. I would recommend this to anyone, who is entertained by mystery.

I had even gone to hear the town council’s debates on the matter, which is why I am able to give such a full and accurate account of the course of events.

It almost seemed as if they stored away their emotions during the day, taking care not to let anyone notice them, and took them out at night when they could be alone. 

Learning Journal 
====

For this Unit's Learning Journal, you will research and identify three peer-reviewed sources for information to add to the essay draft you submitted in Unit 4. Then, for each source, submit the full reference information (formatted using APA Reference section style) followed by at least one quote or paraphrase that you wish to use for your essay formatted using APA in-text citation style. Your paper should be organized as follows:

1) At the top, include the thesis statement you wrote in Learning Journal Unit 3 and used in your Writing Assignment Unit 4 essay.

2) Research and identify three peer-reviewed sources for information to complement the essay draft you submitted in Writing Assignment Unit 4. Your three peer-reviewed sources should clearly align and support your thesis statement. Be mindful that peer-review refers to the selection process used by the publisher. 

3) Below your thesis include at least one quote or paraphrase you wish to use in your essay from each peer-reviewed source. Format your quotes and paraphrases using APA style and accompany them with appropriate in-text citation.

4) At the bottom, include a Reference section formatted using APA style with complete information for each source.

A good place to find peer-reviewed sources is at the UoPeople Library. Review the brief tutorial, How to find a peer-reviewed article in UoPeople Library, for assistance.

Remember, Scribber at www.scribber.com can help you format the full reference listing part (but not the in-text citation) of this assignment. If you do use the website, please remember to select “APA” for the style.

Thesis Statement

To be truly educated means to be able to know how to best acquire knowledge and learn to think about what is true for ourselves. It is more than acquiring a degree.  

Peer-reviewed Sources

"Enabling teachers to know their students' learning styles and making students aware of their own learning styles increases teachers' and students' understanding about the students' learning process, allows teachers to provide better support for their students, and has therefore high potential to enhance teaching and learning" (Sabine, 2009). 

"The need for educators to change their goals for children from conformity and obedience (heteronomy) to critical thinking and choice making (autonomy) is suggested" (Constance, 1991).

The purpose of higher education is to help us live a fulfilling life by becoming a better version of ourselves (Ljiljana, 2021).

Accessing peer-review database

Many peer-reviewed journal on Emory Library don't have abstract displayed, and I can't access the complete journal unless I have Emory Library account. 

Any solution or database alternative to this?
