Introduction
====

This unit will focus on developing your critical reading skills. It will also include a reading from an American male or female writer that you will discuss in the Discussion Forum. Your Written Assignment is to find an abstract on your own (or use one of the provided links) and answer the critical reading questions provided for you in the Written Assignment area. This will be assessed by your peers. Finally, your Learning Journal this week will require you to reflect on how abstracts could assist you in your own research.

Although not required, it is strongly suggested to take the Self-Quiz as they will prove useful study guides for the Graded Quizzes later in the unit.


Discussion Assignment
====


For your Discussion Assignment, you will practice using APA Citations to give credit to the source of the information you read. This is crucial since not giving credit (plagiarism) can lead to a Fail for the assignment, the course and even have you expelled from the university.

You will write a review of the short story you chose from the Unit 5 Reading Assignment story list. You will state which story you picked, why, and give a brief (three or four sentence) summary of the story. You will then say if you liked the story or not and why. At the end of this, you will list:

    One quote formatted using APA in-text citation style.
    One paraphrase formatted using APA in-text citation style.
    The full reference information formatted using APA Reference section style (if you need help with the reference material, you can use Scribber at www.scribber.com but make sure you select APA and not MLA).

Remember, this is to be your own original work, so do not research the stories to see what other people have said and do not include material from any source except the story.

You are also responsible for replying with three or four sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

My review is about a short story, Hangovers, written by Jennifer Pashley. I chose it because I am intrigued by metaphorical expressions used in it. The story seems to be talking about the unpleasant experiences of someone having a hangover and the consequences of getting drunk. It begins by talking about one being drunk, not being to get him/herself home, having to wake up at mid night struggling to stay asleep, staying up alone and cold at night, and feeling irritating in the throat and sick in the stomach the next morning while having to go to work or college. "Sometimes a hangover follows you to college, or to work" (Pashley, para. 4, n.d.). The last part of the story talks about being drunk could put someone in jail and the hospital, where his/her close ones could not do anything to help (Pashley, n.d.). I like this short story because I find the way the author uses metaphorical expressions to depict unpleasant experiences and consequences of being drunk very fascinating and impressive even though it is quite hard to understand.

Written Assignment
====

Review an abstract from the list provided in the Reading Assignment located in the Learning Guide. Based on the information in the abstract, answer the Critical Reading questions listed below. If you cannot fully answer any of the questions, state why you can't and what is missing from the abstract that prevents you from answering the question.

Critical Reading Questions:

1. What is the title of the text and what is the text about?

The tile of the abstract is "Winning and Giving: Football Results and Alumni Giving at Selective Private Colleges and Universities". This is a research about how changes in an institution's success affect giving behavior, if former university athletes are more or less sensitive to their school's competitive success than other alumni, and if the effects depend on the type of institution.

2. What is the author’s view? How do I know? 

In the abstract, the authors don't really give his view, but their research finding. This is the finding, "General giving rates are unaffected by won-lost records at the high-profile Division IA schools and at the Ivy League schools. Increases in winning percentages yield modest positive increases in giving rates, particularly among former athletes, at the lower-profile Division III liberal arts colleges" (Turner et al., 2002).

3. What is the evidence presented by the author to support ideas?

In the abstract, the authors don't really present the evidence to support the finding. Thus, I can't tell what the evidences are. 

4. Is the evidence valid? How do I know?

I can't tell if the evidences are valid or not because they are not provided in the abstract. However, the authors do mention what methods they used in their research to come up with result/finding. 

5. Is the evidence relevant? How do I know?

I can't tell if evidences are relevant or not because they are not provided in the abstract. 

6. Have I heard/read anything similar or dissimilar? What was it?

No, I have not heard anything similar or dissimilar to this particular topic of discussion. 

7. Do I agree or disagree with the views expressed by the author? Why?

I can't say if I agree or disagree with the finding because I need to read the entire research paper to be more informed about all the evidences presented and all the methods used in the research. In addition, I also need to do more research myself on this particular topic so that I can establish more basic knowledge about it and gather more different findings to critically analyze.

Remember: If you use a quote or paraphrase, you need to give the proper APA citations and references.

This Written Assignment is assessed by your peers and will be for a grade. It will be judged mainly for the following:

    Did the student answer all of the questions?
    Did the student analyze the abstract?
    Is it an original work?
    Are there spelling or grammar issues?

Please note that you will not necessarily be provided with assessment aspects during assignment submission periods in your other courses.
 


Learning Journal 
====

For this week's learning journal, write 3-4 sentences on why abstracts are an essential part of academic writing and how you may use them to help you narrow your research focus.

Abstracts are an essential part of academic writing because it helps me save time by providing me key information — what the research is about, what the existing research findings are, what methodology used, what the finding is, and what the implication of the finding is — about the whole research so that I can decide whether or not the research paper suits what I am looking for. By knowing all these information I can decide if I should look deeper into it. At the same time, by just reading the abstract I can gather additional information about the topic itself and different findings or perspectives around it.
