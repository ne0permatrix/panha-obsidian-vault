Introduction


In this unit, you will pick a story from James Joyce’s Dubliners collection and discuss it with the class.  Your Learning Journal will focus on a self-assessment that reflects about your learning experiences in this course from day one to today.


Discussion Assignment


For this Discussion Assignment, you will choose one of James Joyce’s short stories from the link provided in the Unit 8 Reading Assignment and briefly summarize the story for the class. Include with your summary two or three sentences about which story you read and why you either liked or disliked it.

You are also responsible for replying with three or four sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.


I chose the story "A Mother" by James Joyce. This story is about Mrs Kearney and her daughter Kathleen, who both play and perform music very well. Kathleen was offered a contract by Mr Holohan and promised to receive eight guineas (Britain Coin) for playing a role as an accompanist at the four grand tours (Joyce, para. 4, 2001). Mrs Kearney was doing everything to prepare her daughter the best she could and get her ready for the four grand concerts. She even helped with the organizing and conducting of those concerts only to find out that Mr Holohan and the grand concert owners didn't want to pay her daughter the promised coins. She did all she could to fight for her daughter and her own right, but they were only paid half of what was promised. In return, Mrs Kearney and her daughter decided to leave the show without letting her daughter perform in the second part of the grand concert. I like this story because it touches on the gender inequality during that time. It depicts a fighting spirit, which a mother has shown in order to stand up for her own right and her daughter's. This alone could inspire readers to do the same.

ENGL0101 taught me valuable lessons on how to write a coherent, well-structured, and purposeful essay, how to avoid plagiarism by using APA citation style, how to do research for reliable resources — peer-reviewed journals or articles — to include in my essay, and how to read critically. What I really like the most is the fact that this course is structured to have students complete a 5-paragraph essay by the end of the course. I am very proud of my 5-paragraph essay and the effort I put in. In addition, ENGL0101 helped me build the habit of making a summary after reading any text, which I will apply to all my reading in the future. Writing a summary just forces me to comprehensively read the short stories by really reflecting on what the short story is all about in short, what the key message is, and whether or not I like it and why. Regarding what I would like to change, I wish we could emphasize a bit more on how to really have an opinionated and thoughtful discussion. Overall, I am very grateful for your time and effort to help keep the class going smoothly and effectively. Thank you so much, Vanessa.
