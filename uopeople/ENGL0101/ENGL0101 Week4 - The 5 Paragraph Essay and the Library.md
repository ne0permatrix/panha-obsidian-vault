Introduction


This unit will focus on the 5 paragraph essay, how to use the UoPeople Library for research and the difference between a topic and a thesis. It will also include a reading from either an African or Russian writer that you will discuss in the Discussion Forum. Your Written Assignment is to create a 5 paragraph paper of your own based upon the thesis and outline you handed in last week. This will be assessed by your peers. Finally, your Learning Journal this week will be an area just for you to assess your own progress and to write a note to your teacher on your assessment.

Although not required, it is strongly suggested to take the Self-Quiz as they will prove useful study guides for the Graded Quizzes later in the unit.


Discussion Assignment


For your Discussion Assignment, you will practice using APA Citations to give credit to the source of the information you read. This is crucial since not giving credit (plagiarism) can lead to a Fail for the assignment, the course, and even have you expelled from the university.

Choose one of the stories from the readings and then research a critical source within the UoPeople Library or through another source, such as Google Scholar for further information about the story.  For example, this information might come from reviews by others, biographies, or textbooks.  You will then write two or three sentences on what youâ€™ve found for research and how it does (or does not) concur with your concept of the story.

You will include:

    One quote formatted using APA in-text citation style.
    One paraphrase formatted using APA in-text citation style.
    The full reference information formatted using APA Reference section style (if you need help with the reference material, you can use Scribber at www.scribber.com but make sure you select APA and not MLA).

Remember, except for the credited source information this is to be your own original work.

You are also responsible for replying with three or four sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

I discovered from my research that the author, Chekov, tries to talk about the ideas behind idealism and foolishness of youth. "Through this story, Chekov demonstrates the pitfalls of idealism and the foolishness of youth" (Wojcik & Suduiko, 2017, para. 13). If the lawyer was more mature and had more responsibility at the time, he wouldn't take the bet to sacrifice his freedom just to prove his stand for imprisonment for life, which could be considered such a rare action in a society (Wojcik & Suduiko, 2017). I didn't think about this particular aspect of the story, but I agree with Wojcik's & Suduiko's analysis.

Learning Journal


For this Unit's Learning Journal, you will write a two or three sentence assessment of your own progress and a note to your teacher about your assessment.

So far I have been enjoying my experience in ENGL 0101, learning about how to write a 5-paragraph essay, making APA citation, and reading short stories comprehensively. Although I think I have been doing well in term of my overall progress, I still need to work on spreading my workload in small chunks for each day of the week instead of bunching everything into just one or two days. Last but not least, I am very excited for week 5, which will cover how to read critically. 

Time Spent:
