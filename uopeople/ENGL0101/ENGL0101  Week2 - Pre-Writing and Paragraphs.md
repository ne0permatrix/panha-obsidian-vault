# Discussion Assignment

For your Discussion Assignment, you will write a review of the short fairy tale you chose from the Unit 2 reading assignment. You will state which tale you picked, why, and give a brief (one sentence) summary of the story. You will then say if you liked the story or not and why.  Remember, this is to be your own original work, so do not look the stories up to see what other people have said and do not include material from any source except the story.

You are also responsible for replying with three or four sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

- what tale we picked, 
- why we picked it
- a brief summary of the story (ONE-SENTENCE long)
- whether or not we like it and why

I picked "The Happy Prince" because I personally like the takeaway that I got from it. The story is about the statue of the Happy Prince, who sacrificed his beauty and self-image, people's admiration for him, to bring happiness to people who were suffering in his city. I like this tale because it teaches me that real happiness lies beyond just the outside appearance or people's perception of you. With a genuine heart and intent, there is always a pure love to be found.

# Written Assignment

Your Written Assignment for this unit focuses on creating your own illustrative or descriptive paragraph. You get to pick which paragraph style you want to use and you can also pick the topic for your own (three or four sentence) paragraph. This is the main question for your Written Assignment.

This Written Assignment is assessed by your peers and will be for a grade. It will be judged mainly for the following:

    Did the student write a paragraph that is either illustrative or descriptive?
    Is it a full (three or four sentence) paragraph?
    Is it an original work?
    Are there spelling or grammar issues?
    Does the paragraph form a coherent unit?

Please note that you will not necessarily be provided with the assessment aspects during the submission period in your other courses.

# Learning Journal 

For this Unit's Learning Journal, you will write a two or three sentence paragraph on how you used Mind Mapping to select your Topic for the essay project you will work on throughout the course. Let your mind go and explore what topic you want to write about for the next few weeks. Each week we will add information to your draft essay. This week you only need to select a topic. If you want, you can also add a picture of your Mind Map, but that step is optional.

I am a visual learner, so I find Mind Mapping very suitable to me. I used it to note down key ideas, whatever popped up in my head. Then I grouped those ideas based on their similarity to go under the same topic. Moreover, I established connections among them. Finally, whatever group has the most ideas and connections, I chose it as my topic.
