Understand the value of reading and imagining

"I hope we can give our children a world in which they will read, and be read to, and imagine, and understand." ~ Neil Gaiman 

In the article Neil Gaiman talked about the importance of reading in particular reading for fun or reading fiction and the crucial role of library and librarian in helping to create supportive environment for readers and foster the love of reading in young children. This article does its job by helping me understand the role of fiction/reading for fun in building the habit of reading and preserving the love of reading in children. However, I am not quite sure if I agree 100% with one of Neil Gaiman's point of views, "I don’t think there is such a thing as a bad book for children" (Gaiman, 2013). It's not like I disagree with his claim totally, but I just think that it's important for us, the adults, to carefully let children certain sensitive or aggressive content when they're at the right cognitive stage or age.

Written Assignment
====

For this Unit's Written Assignment, you will write a full paragraph about what your favorite story all semester was and why.

My favorite story all semester was "The Elephant Vanishes" written by Haruki Murakami, which is about a private investigation conducted by an ordinary Japanese male citizen, who was very passionate about elephants, on a mysterious local case of a missing old elephant and its keeper. I chose it because three reasons. First, it is a mystery short story, which kept me feeling engaged and lost in the moment while reading it. The writer did a very good job at keeping me mesmerized and curious to find out what will happen at the end of story. Second, I am inspired by how passionate the main character in the story was. He was very passionate about elephants. Because of the love, he became very eager and determined to find out how the elephant and its keeper went missing. He used his own time and resources to gather information for his investigation. Third, the story touches on some good governance aspects of Japanese leaders, which I would like to have in my country, Cambodia. A good practice mentioned in the story is that Japanese people would have their leaders debate about issues in their community so that the public could hear the discussion, know what was going on, understand their leaders' thought process, and analyze their reasoning to make their own well informed and thoughtful decisions. In short, not only does this story make me feel like time flies so fast when I was reading it from the beginning to the end, it also inspires me to be passionate about what I do and gives me a model of governance to look up to. 

Learning Journal 
====

For this assignment, you will hand in to your instructor a fully revised five-paragraph essay that includes information properly cited and referenced from the three different sources you identified for Unit 6. Remember, most of the paper needs to be your own original work (the ice-cream) and the citations should be sparse (the sprinkles). You have worked almost all semester on this paper, so it should be the best copy you can make.

The paper will be assessed using the following criteria:

    Does the student have a thesis?
    Did the paper analyze and support the thesis?
    Is it an original work?
    Are there spelling or grammar issues?
    Does the paper flow well?
