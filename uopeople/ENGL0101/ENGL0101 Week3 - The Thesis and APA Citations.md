Introduction

This unit will focus on creating a thesis and outline for an essay, the topic sentence of a paragraph, and how to quote and paraphrase using the APA Citation style. It will also include a reading from either a Cuban or Haitian writer (you get to choose) that you will discuss in the Discussion Forum. Your Learning Journal this week will be focused on creating an outline based on your thesis for your 5 paragraph essay (the essay will be due at a later date).

This unit also features a Graded Quiz on the subjects from Units 1-3. It is strongly recommended that you take the Self-Quiz before attempting the Graded Quiz.

====

Discussion Assignment

For your Discussion Assignment, you will practice using APA Citations to give credit to the source of the information you read. This is crucial since not giving credit (plagiarism) can lead to a Fail for the assignment, the course and even have you expelled from the university.

You will write a review of the short story you chose from the Unit 3 reading assignment. You will state which tale you picked, why, and give a brief (three or four sentences) summary of the story. You will then say if you liked the story or not and why. At the end of this, you will list:

    - One quote with APA Citations.
    - One paraphrase with APA Citations.
    - The Reference information (if you need help with the reference material, you can use BibMe at www.bibme.org but make sure you select APA and not MLA).

Remember, this is to be your own original work, so do not look the stories up to see what other people have said and do not include material from any source except the story.

You are also responsible for replying with two or three sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

This review is about a short story known as "Ghosts" written by Edwidge Danticat. I chose this story, because I find its ability to tell story about an aspect of a society very fascinating. I want to be able to use my writing to do something similar. This short story is about Pascal and his family who had no choice but to live in a slum and witness firsthand the poverty, corruption, injustice, demonstrations, shooting scenes, crimes, drug deal, and transformation of young men into gang members, who were manipulated and controlled by ambitious businessmen and politicians. Working as a news writer at Radio Zorey, Pascal wanted to have his own show  broadcasting the reality of day-to-day life within the slum and telling true stories of the gang members and the lost ones, whom he called "the ghosts", to the outside world to reach out for help, but his idea was turned down, stolen, and turned into a program called ‘Homme à Homme’. “I’ve already put it out of my mind. ‘Homme à Homme’ is not the show I wanted to do. I wanted to do something closer to the skin, something more personal” (Danticat, 2008, para. 11). Halfway through the story, Tiye, a Baz Benin's leader, framed Pascal for being the mastermind behind a raiding and killing at Radio Zorey just to let him experience the real taste of what it is like to be one of the gang members and to help him get a revelation about the inevitable in the slum. Pascal realized that every young man's life in the slum and his were very vulnerable in the hands of powerful people in their area (Danticat, 2008). I like this short story because it introduces me well to what one would experience living in a slum and what a gangster's life is like. The author does it beautifully calling the lost limbs, family members, and friends — the real ghosts. These losses came back to those who were alive because their lives in the slum forced them to do horrible things to those lost ones (Danticat, 2008).

Note: The thesis must be your own original ideas and thoughts, avoid using ideas from other sources.

For example, these are my own thoughts and this is how I created a thesis and outline from them:
