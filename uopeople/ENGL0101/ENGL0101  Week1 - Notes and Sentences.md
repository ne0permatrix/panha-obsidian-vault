Slide 16 - The Object

The Los Angeles Lakers are the best team in basketball.
"basketball" is the object here which is quite confusing.
"the best team" is just a description and can fool you.
Keynote: **The object is what the subject changes.**
Reflection: I found the object lesson quite tricky.

Discussion Assignment

For your first Discussion Assignment, you will write an ice-breaker statement. An ice-breaker statement is one that introduces yourself to the class. This can be a few (three or four sentences) on your own background and why you've decided to enroll into the UoPeople.

You are also responsible for replying with two or three sentences to three different students and rating their main posts from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) in the Rate box provided.

My name is Panha Suon from Cambodia. For the last one year, I have been passionately exploring regenerative agriculture, business, storytelling, and writing. My dream is to combine these skills together to help solve farmers' problems and environmental problems in my country. By enrolling into the UoPeople, I believe that I will be able to learn about how to run a business, build potential network, and think critically.

Written Assignment

Why do you want to go to college? This is the main question for your Written Assignment. You will write one paragraph (three or four sentences) on this topic.

I have decided to go to college because I want to experience world class higher education and most importantly to inquire necessary knowledge to best learn for myself. I believe that UoPeople is providing me the access to world class curriculum and programs, up-to-date and well-researched information, and diverse global perspectives of different students from all over the world. In addition, I believe that my experience with UoPeople will teach me how to best develop my own way of learning to inquire, formulate worthy questions, challenge standard indoctrination, and proceed independently with the issues in the world in cooperation and solidarity with others. Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of the modern higher education system, once said, "The core principle and requirement of a fulfilled human being is the ability to inquire and create constructively independently without external controls."

Learning Journal 

For this Unit's Learning Journal, you will write a small two or three sentence paragraph on your expectations for this course.  If you are stuck on what to say, just ask yourself the question, ‘What would I teach in this course if I were instructor?’

By the end of this course, I will be able to formulate and organize an informed, coherent, and sophisticated set of ideas about any topic I want to write. I think unity and coherence are two key components which I need to work on and improve. Along with them, it would be very useful for me to be able to implement best practices and standards to avoid plagiarism in my writing.
