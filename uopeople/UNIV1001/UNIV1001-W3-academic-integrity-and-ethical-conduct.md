UNIV1001: Online Education Strategies - AY2022-T1
16-22 September 2021

# Overview
# Introduction
This week, we are going to discuss a very important topic: plagiarism and academic integrity. In order to become a fully effective student at University of the People, you must understand and agree to adhere to the policies and principles of ethical academic conduct, as defined by the university. This statement of Academic Integrity and the Code of Conduct that defines expectations for student behavior is found in the course catalog. If you have not yet, we encourage you to see out the [current course catalog](https://catalog.uopeople.edu/undergraduate-catalog-term-1), available on the UoPeople website, and review the Code of Academic Integrity located under Academic Policies.

Each time you log on to the online campus, you pledge the following:

> _“Through the entry of my username and password, I affirm that I am the student who enrolled in this course for the duration of the entire term. Furthermore, I affirm that I understand and agree to follow the regulations regarding Academic Integrity and Code of Conduct described in the Catalog; I promise not to participate in any form of academic dishonesty including, but not limited to plagiarism, copying, cheating, and/or the submission of work other than my own. Failure to abide by the regulations may result in disciplinary action up to expulsion from the university."_

## Plagiarism
**Excelsior College OWL: What is Plagiarism**

It is crucial to remember the policies concerning plagiarism and to develop a solid understanding of what constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s words or work without giving appropriate credit.

**Read** College Success. [Chapter 6, Section 6.5 The Honest Truth](https://open.lib.umn.edu/collegesuccess/chapter/6-5-the-honest-truth/).

## How to Avoid Plagiarism
Utilizing quality and objective sources, and citing these sources using APA standards, will help you to adhere to the standards of academic integrity and the code of conduct. Correctly citing and referencing are your best defense against accidental plagiarism, so this week we will continue to work on developing APA skills. We will also discuss other strategies to avoid plagiarizing, and consider the ethical implications of cheating.

## Netiquette
As we consider academic integrity and ethical conduct, keep netiquette in mind too. Online discussions lack some of the social cues we depend on in face-to-face conversations, such as body language and tone of voice. That can make online posts easy to misinterpret. Keeping a positive and appropriate tone helps us maintain a positive environment in our learning community. This week, we will explore why conduct and tone are so important to an online learning community.

As you peer assess this week, look for both the strengths and the weaknesses in the assignments you read. Be sure to let your peer know the areas they can improve, but point out the areas they did well, too. To help, here are some sample peer assessments - we encourage you to model your peer assessment responses after the excellent example.

# Learning Journal
### Reflection  

**Topic: Netiquette, peer assessment, and feedback**

Please reflect and answer the following:  

1.  We know that using netiquette online is important, but why? What are the consequences of bad netiquette in the classroom? In your response, be sure to reflect on how it feels to be addressed with bad netiquette, and how you think others feel.

### My Work
What is the correct or acceptable way to communicate on the internet? Online communication is different from a face-to-face interaction because it lacks facial expressions, tones of voice, or body gestures. These social clues are very important on top of the meaning of the text or message itself when it comes to making sure that we interpret the conversation correctly. Without them in online communication, we could misinterpret another person's writing which could lead to conflict or negative atmosphere in our learning environment. What even worse is that we might accidentally scratch open our peer's emotional or mental wounds which could result in hurting their sense of pride, self-esteem, self-confidence, or feeling of security. I am sure that we all don't want to feel like a loser, to doubt ourselves from time to time, to feel insecure, to lose our confidence, and to feel like we don't belong. That's why we should learn and be aware of netiquette when communicating online so that no one has to go through these experiences. 

3.  How does netiquette relate to peer assessment? Why is it important to use good manners when leaving feedback?

Even peer assessment is a form of online communication which is adopted by UoPeople as one of the key learning models. It allows us to look out for each other by giving honest and accurate feedback so that we can learn from our mistakes. However, we want to make sure that we are doing it in a good manners because in the end our goal is to help one another learn, express ourselves, share our ideas and opinions, challenge and help each other to reach our highest potential hopefully in doing something good to alleviate the pain and suffering of ourselves, others and the planet earth. We don't want to do the opposite by dragging each other down. 

5.  How do you feel about the feedback you received this week? What about the feedback you gave?

Of all the feedback I have received this week, I am very grateful for those who really took it seriously by spending their time and attention to give me honest and accurate feedback to the best they could. There hasn't been any bad netiquette happening to me from the moment I enrolled at UoPeople until now. In term of me giving feedback to others, I believe that I have been trying my best to give an as honest and accurate feedback as I could without conducting any bad netiquette. However, one thing I want to improve is to give each feedback a bit more time. 

Your reflection part of the Learning Journal should have a minimum of 300 words, but not more than 600 words.  

### APA Exercise

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite a journal article. These are available in the UoPeople library. Start by going to the library and find a journal article on a topic you’re interested in find a journal article on a topic you’re interested in. Then, complete the following exercise:

1.  What is the title of the article?
2.  Who is the author (or who are the authors)?
3.  What year was the article published?
4.  What is the title of the journal?
5.  What is the Volume number, Issue number, and page numbers?
6.  If the article has a DOI number, what is the DOI? If it does not, what is the URL of the journal’s home page?
7.  Using the information from #1-6, write the APA reference for the journal article you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
8.  Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #7, write the APA in-text citation for the book you found.

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963&section=4).

**Learning Journal Rubric**
The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.

# Discussion Assignment
After our reading this week, it's clear that plagiarism is a sticky ethical issue, ranging from accidental infractions to outright theft of intellectual property. Review the Code of Academic Integrity in the UoPeople Catalog (available on UoPeople's website, [https://www.uopeople.edu](https://www.uopeople.edu)), and then write a reflection answering the following questions:

1. Did any of the information in the Catalog - such as the consequences - surprise you? Why or why not?  
2. Given the potential consequences for plagiarizing, why do you think students engage in plagiarism? Be sure to explore at least two possible reasons why students might plagiarize.
3. What strategies will you use to avoid plagiarism?  

## My Work
1. Did any of the information in the Catalog - such as the consequences - surprise you? Why or why not?  

After I have gone through the catalog and reading materials, there are two facts that surprise me. First, "No more than 10% of your paper should be quoted material" ("How to Avoid Plagiarism", n.d.). Second, if you commit any violation to the General Code of Conduct or Code of Academic Integrity, it will be noted in your student's academic record ("Disciplinary Process", n.d.). 

2. Given the potential consequences for plagiarizing, why do you think students engage in plagiarism? Be sure to explore at least two possible reasons why students might plagiarize.

Plagiarism is an academic violation where a student unintentionally or intentionally take other people's work—writing, thoughts, ideas, or research finding—to put in their work without properly giving them credit ("Code of Academic Integrity", n.d.). I think there are two possible reasons why student might plagiarize. 

First, they unintentional do it due to lack of knowledge of what plagiarism is or how to avoid it. When I first came to UoPeople in my ENGL0101 class, I didn't know clearly what plagiarism is. I had some idea over the fact that if I direct quote someone, I need to put their words in quotation mark. That was it. I didn't know that there's two part of a complete proper citation where first you give an in-text citation and second you give a complete reference to the original source. In addition, I even thought that if I put other's words or ideas in my own words, I don't need to cite it. Thus, before I took ENGL0101 class, I am sure that I had committed plagiarism because I wasn't fully aware of it. 

Second, students plagiarize because they don't take the topic of plagiarism seriously due to the background or education they grew up with. I grew up in a developing country where our education system is not very good. The topic of plagiarism or intellectual right isn't taken seriously. Because of that when I first joined UoPeople, there were moments where I was tempted to not take plagiarism seriously. Sometime when I worked on my assignment especially when I was running out of time to submit it, I tended to not prioritize plagiarism. I wanted to just finish the assignment. Keep this in mind that to avoid plagiarism, student is required to put another layer of effort and understanding in their assignment. Now, I learned that UoPeople takes plagiarism very seriously. 

3. What strategies will you use to avoid plagiarism? 
One main trick I use to avoid plagiarism is to always cite the original source when in doubt. It's never too bad to cite something when you're not certain that it's completely your own idea or words.

### Discussion Requirements  

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used; you should use at least 1 APA citation and reference, but you can use more if needed. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.

### Discussion Responses

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

### Rating Discussions

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

#### Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.
