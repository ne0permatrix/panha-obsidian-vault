## Navigating UNIV 1001

If this is not your first course at UoPeople, this course may look a little different. Some courses provide you with a reading list. This course is built to provide your readings and learning activities within engaging learning content. It is important that you navigate through the learning guide, read the different pages, and interact with the content – click the links, watch the videos. You may be asked to answer questions during the video or practice a concept. Each video and piece of interactive content has a transcript, so if you are unable to watch the video, you can still read the content. Additionally, the “Annotated Resource List” in the learning guide will list all of the unit’s learning content.

#### Student Toolbox

On the right hand side of the course page, you will see the Student Toolbox. The Student Toolbox has links to resources you may find useful in this course.  

#### Learning Resource Center

The [Learning Resource Center](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963) (LRC) is a free resource available to all UoPeople students. The LRC houses the Peer Assessment Office and Online Student Writing Center as well as resources for avoiding plagiarism, UoPeople library access, success skills, sustainability, and others. This resource will be monitored by LRC Officers who are available in Forums to answer study-specific questions  

You can access the LRC from any page here in Moodle by hovering over the “Resources” link in the top navigation bar. Please take a few moments to explore the LRC before continuing on with this week’s lesson, as you will need to be familiar with the resources available in the LRC.
