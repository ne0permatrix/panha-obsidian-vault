# Introduction

Now that you have had a week to get acclimated to your online classroom, we’re going to focus this week __on successful ways to approach and engage your assignments__. You’ll notice three things as you work on assignments here at UoPeople. First, our assignments are heavily __focused on writing and writing skills__ This means the APA skills you started building in Unit 1 will be relevant for almost evert assignment you complete. Second, __discussion__ is a core part of the curriculum. And third, __peer assessment__ is a critical aspect of your assignments each week. Before we move on to your __reading assignments__ for the week, let’s briefly discuss each of __these three aspects of your education__. [[#What are the three aspects?]]

Introduction to Assignments

Take a moment to view this video on __successful way to approach and engage your assignments__. View [Unit 2: Introduction to Assignments](http://www.kaltura.com/tiny/t87hm). If needed, view [Unit 2: Introduction to Assignments Transcript [PDF]](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408833/mod_book/chapter/301556/UNIV1001_Module2short.pdf).

## What are the three aspects?
### Aspect 1 - Writing

Writing is a crucial communication skill, especially online. As such, most of your assignments here are written to give you a lot of practice to build your skills in written communication.

Of course, college-level writing is a little more sophisticated than high school-level writing and has __different expectations when it comes to citation and referencing__. You will likely find that you are expected to do more work for a college paper than you did for a high school paper, and that you will be held to higher standards. But like any skill, it only takes practice to become a better writer. In the video below, students share their favorite tips on the writing process.

**APA Style**

While you’ll have an English composition class as one of your early classes here, we’ll explore some strategies to approach different types of writing assignments this week. Because writing requires APA citations and references, we will also continue practicing our APA format this week. You can also always go back and review the Unit 1 APA activities or review the [LRC's APA Tutorials](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4).

### Aspect 2 - Discussions
As we talked about last week, UoPeople uses a collaborative learning model where students learn as a community and augment each other’s learning. In addition to the larger community of students you are now a part of as a UoPeople student, you’ll experience __collaborative learning__ in two primary areas in your classroom. The first is the ___discussion forum___, and the second is peer assessment of ___Written Assignments___.

Learning is a social activity - when we learn with others, we learn more effectively than we do on our own. Discussions allow us to share our own understanding of that week’s topic, but also allows us to learn from each other. This is why discussions are a central feature of UoPeople’s academic method, and why you’ll have a discussion every week in most of your classes. Through the discussion forum, you have an __opportunity to evaluate and synthesize the perspectives of your classmates__. To make the most of your weekly discussions, __make sure to participate fully because the more you interact, the more you learn__. This week, _we’ll learn some strategies to approach discussion assignments_.

Read and takes notes on the following:
-   [The effectiveness and development of online discussions.](http://jolt.merlot.org/vol5no1/al-shalchi_0309.htm) While this article is intended for designing discussion forums, it also provides a good overview of why discussion forums are effective learning tools. As you read, focus on the ___strengths and benefits of online discussions___. Why do you think discussions are helpful when you learn?
    - **My Note**
		- How many type of discussion are there?
			- 2 types : Synchronous and Asynchronous
		- What is synchronous online discussion?
			- Participants meet at set time to discuss
			- Work collaboratively and get instant feedback
			- People are incline to do it because it's similar to face-to-face discussion
		- What is asynchronous online discussion
			- Participants can meet at anytime to discuss
			- Allows more time and space to think and research about the topic
			- More informative and more meaningful analysis (don't want to look unintelligent or stupid in front of their peers if given enough time think and research)
		- Why do you think discussions are helpful when you learn? 
			- Develops students' critical thinking on the discussed topics
			- Gives equal opportunity to hear other people out and to be heard
			- Gives a comfortable environment for even introvert to raise their voice 
			- Serves as an archive to reflect back later if students' thoughts are the same or if they have looked at the topic from different angle and have changed their thoughts
			- Build a sense of community regardless of where each student might be
		- What is the purpose of online discussion?
			- 3 main reasons to join a discussion
				- Asking for information
				- Asking for clarification
				- Sharing information
		- What are the concerns about online interaction?
			- Concern 1
				- Different subject => Different level of interaction (Not Really)
				- > "Clearly, the student’s participation and interaction in the online discussions will determine whether the discussion will flourish. The students have a big responsibility in making sure that a discussion is successful."
			- Concern 2
				- Missing non-verbal cues : tone of voice, facial expressions, hand gesture
				- In response, students can become cautious in their writing/comment
					- choose their words carefully => not misunderstood or offended
		- What is the misconception about online education?
			- Missing interaction, communication, participation
		- What can instructors do to make online discussion effective?
			- make sure students have a clear understanding of the materials
			- make sure to meet students' need for additional help and/or clarification
		- How to design an effective and successful online discussion?
			- Clear Direction
				- simple, to the point, not cause any confusion among learners
			- Instructor Feedback
				- Apart from direction, what do students need to know?
					- if they address the issue in enough depth
					- if their understanding of the issue is correct
					- if they need clarification on something
			- Promoting Motivation
				- How to motivate students to participate fully in the discussion (providing in depth reflective response) ?
					- find out students' interest and tie them to the discussion or issue
					- not just inform that they'll be graded, but tell them how they'll be graded (guideline and rubric)
					- ![[Pasted image 20210915201802.png]]
			- Expectation
				- Set students with correct expectation 
					- What comment is acceptable (encouraging comment or critic comment)?
					-  Are students encouraged to disagree? How to disagree the right way?
			- Organization
				- Give each discussion its own thread, easy to find and come back to later
			- Question Type
				- Should be a variety of questions in the discussion
					- to ask for students' opinion and relate to their experience
					- to evaluate their work or others'
					- to take side and give reasoning
					- to convince other to see their point of view
					- to have students write questions and have their peer answer them
-   [20 Tips for Writing an A+ Discussion Post for Your Online Class](https://www.saintleo.edu/blog/20-tips-for-writing-an-a-discussion-post-for-your-online-program-class) to learn more about engaging in scholarly discourse.
    
An academic discussion forum’s audience and purpose requires language and style choices different from informal social media. ___Online discussions are used as a way for students to offer insights, test out new theories, and apply and share their ideas___. Using the interaction below, review the following types of responses to understand what constitutes a good quality posting.

![[Pasted image 20210915232909.png]]

Person 1 - This is a poor discussion post response because it does not offer any new insight and offers no details about why the student agrees with the post. It also includes a misspelled word at the end.

Person 2 - This discussion posting is a little better because it offers a new, specific idea, but there is no development. The student mentions examples but then doesn't offer any of those examples. While this posting is better, it would not be a "good" discussion board posting.

Person 3 - This is a better discussion board posting. In this post, the student refers to classroom reading and begins to make a connection to experiences and observations. While this discussion board post is a good post, it could be better with more detail and development.

Person 4 - This is a strong discussion board posting. In this response, the student has made a connection to the class reading, offered an opinion on it, gave reasons for the opinion, and, then, made connections to new research. This insightful response would make for a quality discussion.

### Aspect 3 - Peer Assessments

While writing and discussion are how you demonstrate your learning, peer assessment is an important reflection of your learning. While many students first think of peer assessment as a necessary chore, the truth is that peer assessment is a learning activity that challenges you to apply critical thinking as you read and evaluate your peer’s assignment.

Peer assessment takes two main forms here at UoPeople. First, in discussions, you will rate and respond to at least three of your classmates’ discussion posts. Second, when you have a Written Assignment, you will peer assess three Written Assignments. The criteria to assess will always be provided; you just have to evaluate how well your peer met the criteria. While peer assessment doesn’t always involve conversation, it does involve a number of skills that will enhance your own learning. You’ll need to read carefully, and to assess, you’ll need to understand the concepts you’re assessing. The best way to understand something is to teach it - when peer assessing, you will reach a deeper understanding of course concepts. This week, we’ll explore the benefits of peer assessment. In your weekly Learning Journal, you will practice a Written Assignment peer assessment, too.

Learn about peer assessment by reading and taking notes on the following articles:

-   [Online peer assessment: Method and digital technologies [PDF]](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408833/mod_book/chapter/301563/online%20peer%20assessmnet.pdf?time=1598583544653).    
-   [Research on peer review.](https://www.reap.ac.uk/PEER/Research.aspx)  

For more information on peer assessment visit the [UoPeople Peer Assessment Office (PAO) in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963)

# Discussion Assignment

Writing college-level assignments can be intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be. This week, let’s have a discussion on writing strategies. For this assignment, write at least 250 words - but not more than 500 words - answering the following:

1.  Imagine that you have been asked to speak to your classmates and share your most helpful strategy for college-level writing. What would that strategy be?
    
2.  When you write, what is the difference between writing a paper and writing a discussion post? How does the writing process differ for these two types of assignments? Furthermore, what is the difference between writing an initial discussion post and a response to one of your classmates?
    
Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used. (Last week, you learned how to cite e-books, so be sure to at least cite the textbook in your discussion post this week.) Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help in APA citations.

## My Work
- Share your most helpful strategy for college-level writing.
	- One of the most helpful strategy for college-level writing I would give to anyone is to spend more time on your writing. You can have all the knowledge on how to write a well thought-through, organized, and clear piece of writing, bu t you still can do a poor job if you don't allocate enough time to work on it thoroughly. It's a challenge that I am facing. I believe that I have a great command of English grammar, APA Citation, and how to structure an articulated essay. However, I often end up cramping all the work into one or two days before the deadline, which I believe affects the quality of my work greatly. Hence, I really hope that the rest of us don't fall in the same struggle and have the discipline and technique to spread out the work evenly throughout the given time.  
- Difference between writing a paper and writing a discussion post (Writing Process).
	- Often time a paper is longer than a discussion post. Writing a paper is an in depth work of a chosen/given topic. It requires formal structure like the introduction with a thesis, the body paragraph which includes arguments or points of view, and the conclusion. It could take a longer to complete. On the other hands, discussion post is normally shorter quick writing where you express your opinion or understanding regarding a discussed topic. You can think of it as a group discussion where each group's member is asked to share his or her opinion about the topic. 

- Difference between writing initial discussion post and response to one of your classmate. 
	- When you write a discussion post, you lead the discussion. You could be sharing your opinion, belief, understanding, concern, or reflection on a particular topic. However, when you respond to one of your classmate, you follow their lead according to their points of view. You either support or refute their opinions. 



**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).

**Rating Discussions**

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable. **8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response. **6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating. **4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading. **0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

# Written Assignment

Using your own words, answer each of the following questions:

1.  What is peer assessment, and why do we use it at University of the People?  
2.  What are the benefits of peer assessment?    
3.  What are the challenges of giving peer feedback in peer assessment?   
4.  What are the challenges of receiving peer feedback in peer assessment?   
5.  What strategies will you use to peer assess written assignments? How will you assess discussion assignments?
    
**Written Assignment Requirements**

Your written assignment should be submitted in a Word document _(or compatible program - not that .pages is not an acceptable file format)_ and should be at least 1-2 pages in length (but not more than 4 pages), double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and written in Times New Roman size 12 font.  You should provide a word count at the end of your written assignment. Cite and reference any source(s) you use in the preparation of your essay using proper APA format. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.

**Written Assignment Peer Assessment**

In the unit following the submission of your written assignment, you will peer assess three (3) of your classmates’ assignments according to the instructions found in the Assessment Form. During this peer assessment period, you are expected to provide details in the feedback section of the Assessment Form, indicating why you awarded the grade that you did to your peer. The written assignment grade is comprised of a combination of your submission (90%) and your peer assessments (10%).

Written Assignment Peer Assessment Rubric

For this assignment, your peers will be evaluating your work with the following criteria.
-   Did the student accurately define peer assessment?    
-   Did the student describe why peer assessment is used at UoPeople?    
-   Did the student describe the benefits of peer assessment?   
-   Did the student describe several challenges for giving feedback in peer assessment?    
-   Did the student describe several challenges for receiving feedback in peer assessment?    
-   Did the student describe how they will peer assess written assignments?   
-   Did the student describe how they will assess discussion posts?   
-   Did the student’s paper include these formatting elements: at least 1-2 pages in length double-spaced 1-inch margins written in Times New Roman 12 font include a word count
    
# Learning Journal

**Reflection Topic**

Here is an opportunity to practice your peer assessment skills. While this assignment is fictitious (fabricated), imagine that the following is a class assignment from a peer student. After you read the students assignment, please assess the student’s work using the assessment criteria. You can fill it out and then copy and paste it into the Learning Journal.

1.  Download the [Unit 2 – Fictitious Student Assignment.](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408833/mod_book/chapter/301561/Unit%202-%20Fictitous%20Student%20assignment.docx?time=1608659426352) Read the directions for the assignment that your peer was supposed to follow so you can assess that the student understood the directions completely.   
2.  Read the “Submitted Assignment” completed by your fictitious peer.   
3.  Download the [Fictitious Peer Assessment Criteria](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408833/mod_book/chapter/301561/UNIV%201001%20Unit%202_sample%20peer%20review%20rubric.docx?time=1626196724938) document. Review the grading/assessment criteria, making sure that you understand what criteria you are to grade/assess for this peers assignment.    
4.  Grade/assess the assignment using the assessment form. Make sure that you provide feedback to support the grade/assessment that you have given to your peer - you should write at least 1-2 sentences for each aspect. This includes an overall feedback comment at the end.
You will _ONLY_ submit the assessment grading and feedback information in the Learning Journal, which is in the assessment criteria form.

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite a webpage. Find a webpage related to this week’s peer review exercise on water pollution. Then, complete the following exercise:

1.  What is the title of the webpage?    
2.  Who is the author (or who are the authors)? Note: an author can also be an organization. The Center for Disease Control is an example of an organization that is the author of a webpage.    
3.  What year was the webpage published? Note: if there is no date, you can write “n.d.” instead.   
4.  What is the URL of the webpage?   
5.  Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the webpage you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.    
6.  Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the webpage you found.
    
Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials.](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4)

**Grading Rubric**
The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.

## My Work - Reflection Topic
**1. Reflection Topic**

Element 1

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 10 points  
**Feedback**: You provided detailed information regarding the main pollutants in your community. You even included the pollutants which the environmental council has identified. On top of this, you also explained the effect which chemical agriculture has on water quality around your area.    

Element 2

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 4 points  
**Feedback**: You don’t seem to have included the comparison of the finding in your community with other communities. However, I give you 4 points because you have discussed your finding in your writing.  

Element 3

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 7 points  
**Feedback**: You talked about two of your passions, going for a walk and doing gardening. I don’t think these are skills that could have a direct contribution in helping to improve water quality in your community. For example, going for a walk is not going to build more sidewalks in your community. You still need to raise money and awareness to be able to do it. Similarly, gardening alone will not get more people to grow more trees. There has to be some kind of initiative.  

Element 4

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 6 points  
**Feedback**: Your writing is less than 700 words, but more than 500 words. Also, didn’t include a word count.  

Element 5

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 0 point  
**Feedback**: You had 9 comma mistakes and 4 misspellings.  

Element 6

**Grade (max 10 points)**: 10 points  
**Feedback**: Yes, you include both an introduction and conclusion. 

**General Comment**

Overall, you did a fairly good job. Your writing is easy to understand and addresses most of the points that the instructor wanted you to write about, and you can even improve it more by reviewing lessons on how to use a comma and including extra well-researched information to back up your position or belief. 

## My Work - APA Exercise
"Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment" (Denchak, 2018).

### The Important of Writing
- Summary
	- Why is writing important?
		- No matter how well you understand a concept or remember facts, if you can't explain it to others —normally in a form of writing in college— you can't communicate it to others, and you can't have any influence or make any impact. (para. [[#^fb27cd]])
		- In college, writing is how ideas are exchanged. Writing also has a huge contribution to your final grade. (para. [[#^316d8c]])
		- Believe that you can improve. Put in the work, practice, and you will. (para. [[#^e7c6b7]])
		- Oral Communication vs. Writing? (para. [[#^50cbf8]])
			- **Oral** : You can ask clarifying questions.
			- **Writing**: Ideas or thoughts have to be clear, well thought out and organized.

	- Writing is one of the key skills all successful students must acquire. You might think your main job in a history class is to learn facts about events. So you read your textbook and take notes on important dates, names, causes, and so on. ___But however important these details are to your instructor, they don’t mean much if you can’t explain them in writing.___ Even if you remember the facts well and believe you understand their meaning completely, if you can’t ___express your understanding by communicating it___—in college that almost always means in writing—then as far as others may know, you don’t have an understanding at all. ___In a way, then, learning history is learning to write about history___. ___Think about it. Great historians don’t just know facts and ideas. Great historians use their writing skills to share their facts and ideas effectively with others___.

	- History is just one example. Consider a lab course—a class that’s as much hands-on as any in college. At some point, you’ll be asked to write a step-by-step report on an experiment you have run. The quality of your lab work will not show if you cannot describe that work and state your findings well in writing. Even though many instructors in courses other than English classes may not comment directly on your writing, their judgment of your understanding will still be mostly based on what you write. This means that in all your courses, not just your English courses, instructors expect good writing.
 ^762209
	- In college courses, __writing is how ideas are exchanged__, from scholars to students and from students back to scholars. While the grade in some courses may be based mostly on class participation, oral reports, or multiple-choice exams, writing is by far the single most important form of instruction and assessment. Instructors expect you to learn by writing, and they will grade you on the basis of your writing.
 ^316d8c
	- If you find that a scary thought, take heart! By paying attention to your writing and learning and practicing basic skills, even those who never thought of themselves as good writers can succeed in college writing. As with other college skills, getting off to a good start is mostly a matter of being motivated and developing a confident attitude that you can do it.
 ^e7c6b7
	- As a form of communication, writing is different from oral communication in several ways. Instructors ___expect writing to be well thought out and organized and to explain ideas fully___. In oral communication, the listener can ask for clarification, but in written work, everything must be clear within the writing itself. Guidelines for oral presentations are provided in [Chapter 7 “Interacting with Instructors and Classes”](https://open.lib.umn.edu/collegesuccess/?p=393#lochhaas-ch07).

	- **Note:** Most college students take a writing course their first year, often in the first term. Even if you are not required to take such a class, it’s a good idea for all students to learn more about college writing. This short chapter cannot cover even a small amount of what you will learn in a full writing course. ___Our goal here is to introduce some important writing principles, if you’re not yet familiar with them, or to remind you of things you may have already learned in a writing course.___  As with all advice, always pay the most attention to what your instructor says the terms of a specific assignment may overrule a tip given here!

### Answering Assignment Questions
- Summary
	- [[^]]

- Read in detail below or click this link! [Answering Assignment Questions](https://student.unsw.edu.au/answering-assignment-questions)
	- In order to decide how to answer an essay question, you need to identify what the question requires in terms of content and genre. This guide outlines some methods to help you analyse essay questions.
	- **Analyse the question using key words**
	- Assignment questions can be broken down into parts so that you can better understand what you are being asked to do. It is important to identify key words and phrases in the topic.
	- **What are key words?**
	- **Key words** are the words in an assignment question that tell you the approaches to take when you answer.
	- ![[Pasted image 20210914232700.png]]
	- Make sure you understand the meaning of key words in an essay question, especially **Task words**. As Task words are verbs that direct you and tell you how to go about answering a question, understanding the meaning helps you know exactly what you to do.
	- **Content words** tell you what the topic area(s) of your assignment are and take you halfway towards narrowing down your material and selecting your answer. Content words help you to focus your research and reading on the correct area.
	- **Limiting words** make a broad topic workable. They focus the topic area further by indicating aspects you should narrowly concentrate on.
	- If you're not sure about any aspect of the question, ask your tutor/lecturer for clarification. Never start any assignment until you know and understand exactly what you are being asked to do.
	- **How to use key words**
	- Look for the keywords in your essay question.
	- Underline them.
	- Spend a little time working out what they mean. Use the [Glossary of task words](https://student.unsw.edu.au/node/189) to help you.
