# Introduction
Now that we have finished exploring foundational skills for learning online and submitting assignments, we will spend the next two weeks looking at deeper learning skills. This week, we are going to focus on critical thinking.

The ability to think critically about situations is essential for success in today’s world, both in school and after you graduate. In school, critical thinking is essential for analysis and problem-solving. You need to apply careful critical evaluation to your assignments and demonstrate high-level thinking. In the workforce, you’ll need to be able to think critically to solve problems, evaluate options, and plan.

# Reading Assignment
## Critical Thinking
This week, we will explore the importance of critical thinking. We will also learn a few tools that are useful for critical thinking, and then give you a chance to practice your critical thinking skills.

For this week’s Written Assignment, you will have a chance to put your critical thinking skills to the test when you read the "[Between a Rock and a Hard Place](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408843/mod_book/chapter/301585/BtwnRockAndHardPlace.pdf)" case study. While the case study focuses on sustainability in business environments, you don’t have to be an expert environmentalist or a business guru to understand this week’s case study. In fact, part of your job is to use your critical thinking skills to identify the key issue based on your reading of the case study.  

Read and take notes on the following:

## Improving Your Critical Thinking
It is important to recognize that critical thinking is a multi-step process. It is not enough to read an article or text and then summarize what you read. You must also be able to ask questions to analyze the information further, think about how it applies to real-life situations, and draw your own conclusions based on further information gathering and fact-finding. This is good news and bad news. The bad news is that this isn’t a process most of us are born knowing, so it takes time to learn how to think critically. But the good news is that critical thinking and analysis are learnable skills. Not only can you learn how to think critically and analyze issues around you, but you can learn how to improve your critical thinking skills.

# Discussion Assignment

Job postings often state that the successful applicant must have superior critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Yet employers tell college administrators that graduates, both from undergraduate and graduate programs, often lack these skills.

1.  Having read this week's assigned materials, how would you define critical thinking?
2.  Why are employers making these comments? Are they justified – should colleges be responsible for teaching critical thinking? If not, whose job is it?

## My Work
Critical thinking is a process we can learn or a skill we can develop to increase our chance of making good informed decisions in our daily life based on facts, evidences, and logic other than emotions, biases, or blind beliefs. We want to make sure that we make better decision most of the time, because they can have a lasting impact on our lives ("College success", p. 108).  

The fact that employers are making these comments on the demand for employees with critical thinking and problem-solving skill and the inability of our workforce to meet that demand reinforces how important these skills are and shows us that there's something wrong within the making of our human resource. 

I don't think that responsibility of teaching critical thinking is a sole job of anyone in particular. "Critical thinking isn't a process most of us are born knowing, so it takes time to learn how to think critically" ("Improving your critical thinking", n.d.). Just like any other skills, an individual needs to invest time and effort to learn and practice critical thinking to effectively apply it in their day-to-day life. Therefore, the environment that they grow up in or are exposing to —their family, their circle of friend, their school—can potentially foster critical thinking. 

For example, I first learned about critical thinking and really applied it in life through countless debates and discussions with my cousin who is an engineer. He introduced me to this skill. Our conversations forced me to think critically. That was how I came across it, but I am still not effective at it because I haven't substantially learned it or practiced it enough.

Now imagine that I grew up in a family where critical thinking was a discussion topic at our dinner table and embedded in every decision process and conversation we had, I would be very efficient and effective with it without even have to go through university.

#### Discussion Requirements

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used; you should use at least 1 APA citation and reference, but you can use more if needed. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.  

#### Discussion Responses

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

#### Rating Discussions

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

##### Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.
# Written Assignment

For this week’s Written Assignment, you have a chance to practice your critical thinking skills. Read the Case Study [Between a Rock and a Hard Place [PDF]](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408843/mod_book/chapter/301584/Mini%20Case%20Study_Between%20a%20Rock%20and%20a%20Hard%20Place.pdf) and write an analysis. The goal is to demonstrate critical thinking in your analysis; you do not need to be a sustainability or business expert to critically analyze this case study. In your analysis, be sure to include:

1.  A summary of the issue. Briefly, what are the key facts of the case study?
2.  Use of at least one critical thinking strategy or tool to analyze the situation and highlight key facts. Be sure to specifically identify the tool you select and describe its use.
3.  A recommendation to resolve the situation, along with reasons why you recommend this solution.

Nasira’s workplace, K9 Dura-Corp, has just lost an old manufacturer who made fabric lining for one of their products, dog cot. Her job, as a procurement specialist, is to find a new source for it immediately and to make sure that the price fits their product line. Otherwise, K9 Dura-Corp would have product delays, and she will be looking at a possible lay-off. The real issue lies in the fact that she cannot choose between the only two sources that she could find, Fab-Right Inc. and All-Fabric Inc.  

Next, I am going to discuss the critical thinking process recommended in our coursebook, “College Success”. “The critical thinking process is really nothing more than asking the right questions to understand a problem or issue and then gathering the data you need to complete the decision or take sides on an issue” (“College success”, 2015, p. 109). The process is divided into 4 main parts, (1) determine what you are trying to do, (2) gather information, (3) evaluate the strength of your information, and (4) do what you're here to do. 

First, before going through a critical thinking process, you should know what it is you're trying to achieve. You can ask yourself these questions. What is your objective? Are you trying to make a decision? Are you deciding about side to take? Are you trying to come up to a conclusion of some sort? Or are you just trying to validating a source of information to know whether or not you can trust it? Having the answers to these questions gives you a clear idea of what you are trying to do which will help you structure your information gathering process.
Following this step, Nasira should be able to identify what it is she had to do. In this case, she had to decide which manufacturer to choose. 

Second, after you have a clear purpose of what your objective is conducting the critical thinking assessment, you then can start gather information. If you are trying to make a decision about what to do or not to do, you can ask yourself.  What are the available options/choices? If you are deciding what position of an issue to take, then find out what sides are presented to you. If you are assessing the credibility or validity of a piece of writing or conversation, ask yourself what author's argument is and what evidences are presented. When you have all these options, choices, sides, or evidences, compare them among one another to find out what difference is. To get a sense of how they might be different, you can think through different scenarios that might occur when you choose one options or side over the others. In short, you need to make sure that you gather all supporting  information for each point of view. 

From this step, Nasira should be able to tell what the key facts in our case study. According to "Mini case study : Between a rock and hard place" (n.d.):
	Nasira's company, K9 Dura-Corp, didn't have a fabric lining manufacturer for their product, dog cots. It's her job to find new source immediately. She found two manufacturers, Fab-Right Inc. and All-Fabric Inc.  Fab-Right Inc. was cheaper and touted for as chew-proof. On the other hand, All-Fabric Inc. was reported for how they contaminated the local water source. 

Third, with all these information you just gathered, it is now time to evaluate their credibility. You want to know if the information that support each viewpoint or argument are factual and not just someone's opinion. What is the source of this information? Who are the authors? Are the author well respected in their fields? You also need to look for possible biases from both the authors or yourself. Do the authors have any vested interest in the position they are taking or the arguments they made? For you, if you decide to take a position or make a decision, is there a possible personal tie related to the chosen position or decision? More importantly, are there any fallacies in your logic or the authors'? 

Reflecting back to the information about Fab-Right Inc. and All-Fabric Inc. that Nasira gathered, she can evaluate them using questions in step number 3. For example, for the first manufacture, Fab-Right Inc., she concerned about employee's unfair weigh and their terrible working condition. On top of that, she also wasn't happy with the rumor that about their environmental impact of their manufacturing process. However, these concerns are not back up by reliable sources or data. In contrast, it is clear that All-Fabric Inc. was contaminating the local water source because they were reported. 

Last but not least, step number 4, after you have now identified what your objective is, what available information is presented to you, and evaluated the strength of the information, you should be able make well-informed and reasonable decision, take strong position, or successfully come to a conclusion. 

From the evaluation section above, Nsira should be able to see clearly that Fab-Right Inc. is a better option than All-Fabric Inc. despite those poorly-supported under-paid weigh and environmental rumor due to its cheap price and chew-proof quality. All-Fabric Inc., on the other hand, was reported for local water source contamination and known for manufacturing less durable fabric which could be prone to a chewing hazard of dogs.

## Excellent Sample of My Classmate's Work
UNIT 4 – WRITTEN ASSESSMENT

BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE

The case study ‘Between a Rock and a Hard Place’ talked about a woman named Nasira who was a Procurement Specialist, and the firm she worked at called K9 Dura-corp. It emphasized her situation where she had to choose between two unfit suppliers. She was under the pressure of time and a delay could have brought a halt to their production line and could have possibly resulted in her and many others losing their jobs.

K9 Dura-Corp was based in Michigan and manufactured dog beds, cat scratching posts, pet carriers, and other pet supplies. They relied on the “Made in America” tagline to market their products. Nasira’s job entailed her choosing an ideal manufacturer that was the right fit for them and focused on quality, ethical manufacturing practices, and environmentally conscious methods. In the case study, as K9DC’s manufacturer went out of business, Nasira had to find and choose a fabric lining manufacturer for their dog cots. After extensive research, she had shortlisted two suppliers – Fab-Right Inc. and All-Fabric Inc.

Using the Ladder of inference (The Systems Thinker, 2016) and the steps therein, we can effectively reach a decision that has the best outcome for K9DC.  
1. Available Data:  
The case study is all the information presented about K9DC, Nasira, Fab-Right Inc., and All-Fabric Inc.  
2. Select Data:  
Selecting relevant information from the case study to reach an informed and effective decision between the two unideal manufacturers of fabric lining for dog cots. This includes the advantages and disadvantages of each option, their impact on the environment, the quality of their work, and the ethical standards they follow.  
3. Paraphrase Data & Name What is Happening:  
Fab-Right Inc. was an overseas supplier that produced the fabric lining at a cheaper cost and their materials were chew-proof. But they exploited their workers and had terrible working conditions, and no information about their manufacturing process’s environmental impact was presented. On the other hand, All-Fabric Inc. was a local Midwestern supplier whose fabric lining was less durable, their manufacturing process was not up to the standards of K9DC, and their manufacturing process had negative environmental impacts that caused friction in the community and lead to the Local Government’s intervention.  
4. Evaluate What is Happening:  
Choosing Fab-Right Inc would result in an overall cheaper production process for K9DC. Being a chew-proof material, their products will have higher quality and durability to compete with similar products on the market. On the other hand, as they paid minimal salaries to their workers and had an unsuitable work environment, it might cause legal and ethical problems for K9DC. An environmental impact study is very important for all businesses which Fab-Right did not provide. If they are damaging the environment, it can cause problems and damage K9DC’s reputation.  Moreover, Fab-Right is not an American supplier which means it goes against K9DC’s marketing strategy of “Made in America”.  
Choosing All-Fabric Inc. would result in poor quality and less durable products on the K9DC’s line. This was a result of the sub-standard manufacturing process used by them. Being affiliated with a supplier that has a bad reputation in their community as a result of contaminating water and damaging the environment is not a beneficial and smart move in the public’s eye.  On the contrary, sourcing parts from an American, and especially a Midwestern business will definitely support K9DC’s marketing strategy and further strengthen their relationship with customers as they will be perceived as a brand that “does not lie”.  
5. Decide What to Do & Reflexive Loop:  
Being under the pressure of time and at risk of losing her new job, Nasira should choose the option with more advantages and a few manageable disadvantages. According to me, choosing quality over perception is a better strategy for K9 Dura-Corp in the long run. Nasira should choose Fab-Right Inc over All-Fabric Inc. as a supplier of fabric lining for their dog cots. They provide better quality and better durability at a lower cost. By hiring an overseas supplier, K9DC will only have to make small changes in their marketing campaign “Made in America”, as they assemble their products in Michigan itself. Additionally, Nasira will have to gather more information about the environmental impacts of their manufacturing process. Using Fab-Rights’s fabric lining will fit in appropriately within K9DC’s quality parameters and price bracket.

# Learning Journal
**Reflection Topic: Critical thinking and peer assessment** 

Reflect and write at least 300 words (but not more than 500 words) on the following:  

1.  How does critical thinking relate to peer assessment? What strategies from this week can you apply when you assess Written Assignments?
2.  At this point, you have completed a practice assessment and an actual assessment of a Written Assignment. You have also rated posts each week on the Discussion Board. Has any part of the process surprised you? Do you have any concerns about assessment?

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite an online video file like a TED talk or Youtube video. Use the internet to find a video about critical thinking, such as a TED talk or a Youtube video. Then, complete the following exercise:

1.  What is the title of the video?
2.  Who is the speaker (or who uploaded the video)?
3.  What year was the video published?
4.  What URL is the video available at?
5.  Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the video file you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
6.  Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the video you found.

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4).  A TED talk is cited like a [Youtube video](https://my.uopeople.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=223403&chapterid=250832), with the speaker in place of the uploader.  

## My Work - Reflection
**Reflection Topic**

There are two parts to peer assessment at UoPeople. One of them happens in our weekly discussion forum where we're required to rate and give feedback to at least three of our classmates' work. Another one occurs in our written assignment where we assess three of our classmates' written assignment. Critical thinking is nothing more than just asking the right questions to understand a discussed topic, problem, or issue then gather enough information, and evaluate them so that we can make a well-informed decision or take a right position ("College success", 2015, p. 109). It is applied to not just when we give feedback, but also when we receive them. 

When we are giving feedback to our peers, we want to make sure that we understand clearly what the writer is saying, what arguments they are making, and what position they take. This is a part of the critical thinking process where we are trying to gather information to really understand what the writer is trying to say. Then we can start evaluating the argument, supporting evidences, and the source of those information to find out if there's any weakness or fallacy.  After we have done that, we can decide whether or not we agree with the writer and if the writer has made a well-written work that clearly communicates their viewpoints and messages. Similarly, when are receiving feedback, critical thinking can also help us assess what our peers are telling us and decide whether or not it is a reasonable and constructive feedback to accept or follow. 

Regarding the surprise and concerns, I haven't had any.
