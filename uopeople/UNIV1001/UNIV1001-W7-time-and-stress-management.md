# Introduction
![[Pasted image 20211018053331.png]]

Last week, we talked about reading and study skills. This week, we’re going to look at another important set of academic skills: time and stress management. 

It’s no secret that balancing everything can be a tough job. As a student, your life is full of competing priorities, multiple demands on your time, and plenty of stress. On top of school, you have to balance work, family, and find time for your hobbies. What’s the secret to managing everything - how do you cope when you have so many different things to do?

## Time Management
The secret to success, in school, and after your graduate, is excellent time management. Especially in online classes, you need to be both organized and self-motivated to complete your work on time. Everyone has the same number of hours in a day - you cannot add more time to your day. You can, however, choose to make more effective use of your time.

Further, maintaining strong time management and organizational skills can prevent you from becoming overwhelmed and stressed when managing multiple priorities. **When we feel overwhelmed, many of us have the tendency to procrastinate**. This causes us to fall further behind, thus resulting in an even greater accumulation of stress. As such, managing our time better helps manage stress levels. This week, we will learn more about time management strategies and how to make more efficient use of our time.

**Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator**

Tim Urban knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.

Select a response for each item below.

**1. When you try to manage your time for each item below.**
- *I procrastinate.*
	- Content
		- Procrastination is something that we all do, but ***focusing on the important tasks you need to get done each day, and then checking them off one-by-one is a good way to combat procrastination***. Think about what really needs to get done in a given day or week (**maximum 7 tasks for the day**) and then estimate how long each task will take, then divide your day into manageable chunks.
		- Always over-estimate rather than underestimate the ***time required and consider your energy cycle*** to determine when you will be the most productive. But remember, sticking to your plan is as important as making the plan itself. Also, make sure to also keep a calendar of all of the assignments you have due and any important events so that you are able to plan your time accordingly. Writing them on a paper calendar will give you a constant visual reminder, but phone apps like todist are also effective.
		- Starting early on things will give you time to work and play hard. For more study tips check out the Exam Prep Toolkit or try the UBC Assignment Calculator to help you determine how long a given assignment will take.
	- **Summary** 
		- Focus on tasks you really have to get done each day or week (7 tasks). Dive into them one by one.  
		- Better to overestimate the time required to complete a task.
		- Keep track (on physical / online calendar or app) of all important dates, events, or assignment deadline so that you can plan ahead. 

- *I'm too busy.*
	- Content
		- The reality of life is that everyone is busy. What is important is to make the most of your time so that you are able to get the necessary things done. ***Scheduling your time is an important part of being productive.*** Make sure to keep a calendar of all of the assignments you have due and any important events so that you are able to plan your time accordingly. Writing them on a paper calendar will give you a constant visual reminder, but phone apps like todist are also effective.
		- Keeping a weekly and daily schedule is also important to getting real things accomplished. Think about what really needs to get done (maximum 7 tasks for the day) and then estimate how long each task will take, then divide your day into manageable chunks.
		- Always over-estimate rather than underestimate the time required and consider your energy cycle to determine when you will be the most productive. But remember, sticking to your plan is as important as making the plan itself.

		- Scheduling helps us plan, set chunks of time aside, and make time to do what's really important to us. 
		- Know your goals and deadline. Overestimate how much time needed to get each task done. Put those task on calendar or app (max. 7 tasks). Dive into them one by one. 
		
- *I forget deadlines.*
	- Content
		- Keeping track of deadlines is an integral part of time management. At the beginning of every semester write down all of the assignments you have due and any important events on a calendar so that you are able to plan your time accordingly. Writing them on a paper calendar will give you a constant visual reminder, but phone apps like todist are also effective. Keeping a weekly and daily schedule is also important to getting real things accomplished.

	- **Summary**
		- To avoid forgetting the deadlines, write them down or note them down of them at the beginning of the term (important events, assignment deadlines, project deadlines). 
	
**2. When you are studying, what do you waste the most time doing?**
- *Using my phone.*
	- Content
		- Getting rid of distractions is important when studying or working on assignments. It’s best to only have the things you actually need to complete your assignments when you’re doing school work, which means putting away your phone or even turning it off all together (your friends will still be there when you turn it back on). If you waste a lot of time on specific apps try an app blocker.
	- **Summary**
		- Phone could be a main source of distraction. When you're studying, put it away (Out of sight, out of mind). Or even turn it off. 
		- You should need have what you really need to finish the assignment. 
		
- *Surfing the internet*
	- Content
		- Getting rid of distractions is important when studying or working on assignments. It’s best to only have the things you actually need to complete your assignments when you’re doing school work, which means putting away your computer if you don’t need it, or turning off the wifi if your assignment doesn’t require online research. If you waste a lot of time on specific apps try an app blocker.
		- If you’re not even sure where your time is being wasted, read this article from College Info Geek which gives you information on various ways to track your productivity.
	- **Summary**
		- Internet can also be a great distraction when studying. If not needed, turn it off or turn off all the notification (use "Do Not Disturb" mode on your laptop)

- *Socializing*
	- Content
		- While it is nice to study with friends, sometimes we get the most work done when we do school work in isolation. Finding a quiet place to study or work will allow you to limit the amount you are distracted by your friends. If you study in short bursts and take frequent breaks, you can use you ‘break’ time for socializing, while still being productive.
	- **Summary**
		- Having your friends around could distract you and decrease your studying productivity, so find a quiet place isolated from people or friends. 
		- In term of socializing with friends, you will always have time for that. Avoid doing it during your studying time. 

- *I don't even know.*
	- Content
		- If you’re not even sure where your time is being wasted, read this article from College Info Geek which gives you information on various ways to track your productivity.
  
**3. Multi-tasking is the best way to keep on top of all the things you need to get done.**

- *True*
	- Content
		- Sadly we all like to believe that multi-tasking is the best use of our time, but the fact is that ***we all do better work when we work on one thing at a time***. When we multi-task we always give one activity more of our attention despite thinking that we are doing two (or more things) well at once. Doing just one thing at a time has become increasingly difficult with the connectivity that the internet and cellphones afford, however staying focused will allow you to use the time you do have more efficiently, leaving more focused time for having fun.
	- **Summary**
		- Our ability to focus or spend attention fully on one single task at a time is crucial to increase efficiency of your studying. 
		- With constant connectivity and devices, we need to make sure that we are able to focus when we study. 

- *False*
	- Content
		- Correct. Unfortunately many of us like to believe that multi-tasking is the best use of our time, but the fact is that we all do better work when we work on one thing at a time. When we multi-task we always give one activity more of our attention despite thinking that we are doing two (or more things) well at once. Doing just one thing at a time has become increasingly difficult with the connectivity that the internet and cellphones afford, however staying focused will allow you to use the time you do have more efficiently, leaving more focused time for having fun.

# Discussion Assignment
Stress, both good and bad, is a part of life. In the discussion forum discuss the following:

1.  Why is stress management important? How has stress affected your life?
2.  Identify three stress management techniques you are going to use to decrease your stress levels. How can you apply these strategies to your life? How will these strategies help you manage your stress?

**Discussion Requirements**

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words.  

Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.  

**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

**Rating Discussions**

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

**Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:**

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

## My Work
"Students are one of the most common victims of stress" (Malik, 2016). As a student, it is important for us to be aware of our daily level of stress, identify our stressors, and manage them properly. Otherwise,  unbalanced level of stress could make us unhappy, unhealthy, and less productive and possibly lead to bad school performance or worth chronic anxiety and severe depression. 

According to Malik (2016), there are three kinds of common stress: social stress, academic stress, and daily life stress. Since I enrolled at UoPeople I have experienced social stress and academic stress. As for social stress, I am dealing with balancing my academic life at UoPeople with my normal day-to-day life and work. The academic stress pretty much results from poor time management and my poor reading comprehension skill/active reading skill.  

Before studying this lesson, I couldn't tell if or when I stress out. Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention to it. Now I know that stress could simply be noticed when you feel worried or anxious about something. To decrease my stress level right now I think these three stress management techniques would work. 

First, I need to manage my time better. For me, that means allocating more time and schedule my studying hours for each day in my phone where I can be reminded. Second, when I stress out, I can get moving meaning I can exercise, workout, or go for a run. I have tried this before and it works for me. Sometimes if I exercise or play sport with other people, I even get to laugh and release stress. Third, I can make time for fun or relaxation. I think what can give me fun would be to scribble or day trade. Even though day trading doesn't really sound relaxing, scribbling in a way does. It's like drawing where you can concentrate or meditate actually. It gives me a sense of peace in mind.

# Written Assignment
As you read about in the textbook this week, goal-setting is an important strategy to manage your time and stay on track with your education. Reflect on the importance of goal-setting, and answer the following questions:

1.  Briefly, share a time when you set a goal and did not accomplish it, and then share a time when you set a goal and successfully achieved it. Why weren’t you successful in your first example? Why were you successful in your second example?
2.  Why does effective goal-setting help us achieve goals? What are the characteristics of good goals?
3.  Based on your answer to questions 1 and 2, set three goals: one short-term, one mid-term, and one long-term  
    

**Written Assignment Requirements**

Your written assignment should be submitted in a Word document _(or compatible program - not that .pages is not an acceptable file format)_ and should be at least 1-2 pages in length (but not more than 4 pages), double-spaced with 1-inch margins, and written in Times New Roman size 12 font.  You should provide a word count at the end of your written assignment.  

Cite any reference(s) you use in the preparation of your essay using proper APA format. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.  

**Written Assignment Peer Assessment**

In the unit following the submission of your written assignment, you will peer assess three (3) of your classmates’ assignments according to the instructions found in the Assessment Form. During this peer assessment period, you are expected to provide details in the feedback section of the Assessment Form, indicating why you awarded the grade that you did to your peer. The written assignment grade is comprised of a combination of your submission (90%) and your peer assessments (10%).  

**Written Assignment Peer Assessment Rubric**

## My Work

"In many colleges in the United States, almost half of first-year college students will not make it to graduation" (*College Success*, 2015). Doing well in college isn't easy. It requires motivation, commitment, determination, perseverence, and a lot of self-discipline to inquire all the skills needed to help you excel in college. It's a whole discipline on its own. Among all those skills, "time management skills can make the difference between those who graduate from college and those who drop out" (*College Success*, 2015). 

In our earlier chapters, we were studying about active learning techniques and how to be a successful self-directed learning. For this chapter, we are studying about time management in relation to stress. Among all the stress management technique, being able to manage your time properly is a very effective method to balance your daily stress as a student. An integral part of time management is the ability to set goal to manage time and stay on track of all your responsibilities and obligations. 

Throughout my studying journey with UoPeople, I have set a goal to spend more time on my studying for each course I am taking, but I didn't achieve this goal, or it didn't really have any impact on my studying. Why? If we look at the goal again, we can notice that this goal, to spend more time, is not measurable at all. I was not really telling myself how much I want to spend on my studying in order for me to perform better in each course. It is specific as it emphasizes on time aspect of my university experience, but that's not enough. Also, my goal didn't have deadline. To improve do it better, I can reset my goal. I can say, "My goal is to study 14 hours a week which is equivalent to 2 hours a day for one course starting from today till the end of my UNIV1001 course."

Looking at the bright side of my university experience so far, I have set myself a goal to wake up at 5 or 5:30AM and study for 2 hours before going to do anything else. I have successfully done it for the last two weeks or so. This goal is specific and measurable which make the whole process very simple. When I wake up, I just need to get to my desk and start studying for 2 hours. That's why I am able to do it. 

Effective goal setting helps you achieve your goals because it gives us clarity of what we visualize and want to achieve. In a way that gives us a kind of motivation. Moreover, an effective goal setting allows us to keep track of our progress and eventually reflect back to accurately evaluate our implementation process. I have been following the SMART technique for goal setting which consists of five key characteristics: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bounced. 

Based on the SMART technique, here are my goals which I was able to come up with:

Short-term Goal

# Learning Journal
**Reflection Topic: Time Management**

Complete [Activity 2 and Activity 3 in Chapter 2](https://open.lib.umn.edu/collegesuccess/chapter/2-3-organizing-your-time/) of the textbook, and then address the following questions:
1.  Compare the results of your personal time allocation to your ideal time allocation. Are you close to your ideal allocation? If not, what factors are affecting your use of time?
2.  Based on what you’ve read this week, what strategies can you use to more effectively manage your time? Be sure to identify at least three time management strategies, and describe how you will apply them.

Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 300 words (but not more than 500 words).

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. For the first 4 weeks of this class, we have practiced how to cite and reference different kinds materials – books, articles, website, and videos. While there are other kinds of materials that can be cited and referenced, most will be very similar to what you have already learned, and so we are working on quoting and paraphrasing.

This week, we will continue working on how to correctly quote and how to correctly paraphrase. Go back to the video you found for our Week 4 APA exercise. Then, complete the following exercise:
1.  What was the full reference for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week).
2.  What was the in-text citation for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week).
3.  If your video had a transcript, find a paragraph from the transcript, and copy and paste it here. If it did not, do your best to include a full sentence directly from the video.
4.  Select a section from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the section in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.
5.  Re-read the section from #3, and re-write it in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing).

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC.](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4)

**Learning Journal Rubric**

The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.

## My Work - Reflection
Compare the results of your personal time allocation to your ideal time allocation. Are you close to your ideal allocation? If not, what factors are affecting your use of time?

My personal time allocation is not close to ideal, because I didn't know what I was doing. I allocated my time based on what I think was right or what made sense to me. For example, I don't have a real picture of how my hours are spent each week on what type of activity categories. Regarding the time personality, I have a more relaxed attitude toward time or in another word I couldn't account for how I used all my time. Therefore, according to *College Success* (2015), I might think that I have already spent a lot of time studying, but still I seem to not have enough time, yet in reality I might have been wasting a lot of my time on less important tasks. 

Based on what you’ve read this week, what strategies can you use to more effectively manage your time? Be sure to identify at least three time management strategies, and describe how you will apply them.

UNIV 1001 Online Education Strategies has helped me tremendously on assessing my current learning techniques, habits, and mindset especially when it comes to time management, stress management, goal setting, and scheduling. The following is the techniques that I believe will improve my time management and ultimately my study performance. 

Firstly, out of all the time management techniques suggested, I think creating a calendar planners and To-Do lists would significantly help me take control of my time more effectively. They are what has been missing in my studying so far. Secondly, before I can create a calendar planners and To-Do lists, I need to establish a record of how I spend my hours and where they are distributed into. Last but not least, as a student who works, I need to also have clear long-term goals, mid-term goals, and short-term goals to keep me driven and motivated when I encounter hardships. These goals allow me to prioritize what I do so that I don't waste time on things that aren't necessary. Whether I like it or not, working and studying at college at the same will not be easy; therefore, I need to be mentally aware of that fact. I believe that all the three techniques mentioned will greatly help me to prepare and succeed in both.

## My Work - APA Exercises

- What was the full reference for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week).

   Bite-sized Philosophy. (2017, December 7). *Jordan Peterson - The best way to learn critical thinking* [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0vUsxhMczI
	
- What was the in-text citation for the video you found for the Week 4 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week).

   "The best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write" (Bite-sized Philosophy, 2017).

- If your video had a transcript, find a paragraph from the transcript, and copy and paste it here. If it did not, do your best to include a full sentence directly from the video.

	One of the things that just blows me away about university is that no one ever tells students why they should write something. Well they tell, "You have to do this assignment. You need the grade." No, you need to learn to think because thinking makes you actively effective in the world. Thinking makes you win the battles you undertake. And those could be battles for good things. If you can think, speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way. That's why you learn to write.   
   
- Select a section from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the section in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.

According to Bite-size Philosophy (2017), "If you can think, speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way."

- Re-read the section from #3, and re-write it in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing).

Being able to think critically and communicate thoughts effectively through verbal conversation or written work will help you succeed in today's world (Bite-size Philosophy, 2017).
