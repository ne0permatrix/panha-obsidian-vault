**Read: ** College Success. [Chapter 6: Preparing for and taking tests.](https://open.lib.umn.edu/collegesuccess/part/chapter-6-preparing-for-and-taking-tests/)

- **Summary**
	- Testing is a part of life. It occurs when someone ask us questions, when we join a competition, and so on. We are fine or even have fun when we measure our progress like that. However,when it comes to testing in college, we rarely enjoy it. 
	- Testing in high school is different from in college where you are tested for your understanding of the materials, your thoughts, your interpretations, your thinking process, and your conclusion other than your memorization. 
	- Testing in college helps measure your progress toward a mastery of a skill set. It is not a representation of your talent or how smart you are. It just gauges how much you know about a certain topic at a specific point in time. Also, it is a great opportunity to learn. 

In most college classes, tests and exams are one way that student learning is assessed. At UoPeople, quizzes and tests comprise a portion of your grade. Quizzes and exams are a regular feature of college classes. Most undergraduate courses at UoPeople have a quiz in week 3, a quiz in week 6, and a final exam in week 9. Some courses will have a proctored final exam, which means you are responsible for finding a responsible adult to serve as a proctor. The proctor is responsible for verifying the student’s identity to allow the student to access the exam.

While the percentage varies from class to class, you can expect your final exam to be worth at least 20% of your grade. This means that it is important to prepare for your final exam because it is a significant portion of your grade. As such, this week we will explore strategies for effective preparation and exam-taking.

## Test Anxiety
The importance of exams has one unfortunate side effect: test anxiety. It is very common for students to be stressed and anxious about their exam. This anxiety can make it difficult to study effectively and can even make it harder to take the test. Understanding how to prevent, reduce, and manage test-taking anxiety will help you both feel better, and perform better on your test. To help, we will also review some techniques to reduce test-taking anxiety.

Clearly, one of the best strategies to avoid test anxiety is to **study ahead of time** and to be aware of **what you’ll be tested on**. Additionally, it’s important to understand the details of the **exam format** to avoid unnecessary anxiety.  

On that note, your final exam is next week. The final exam period runs Thursday-Sunday; final exams must be completed no later than Sunday at 11:55 pm UoPeople time. To help you prepare, Unit 8 and Unit 9 both open at the beginning of Unit 8. The Review Quiz in Unit 9 is a helpful study aid for your final exam.

# Discussion Assignment

Your final exam is next week; you will have a four-day window to take your exam. (While the unit is open the full week, you can only take your exam Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday).  Answer the following in the discussion forum:  

1.  What strategies will you use to prepare for your final exam?
2.  Do you have, or have you ever had test-taking anxiety? What strategies will you use to manage test anxiety?

**Discussion Requirements**

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words.  

Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.  

**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

**Rating Discussions**

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

**Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:**

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

## My Work

Testing is a part of life. We are tested when a child ask us a question, when we join any kind of competition, when we facing obstacles or challenges, and so on. It doesn't always have to be daunting if we look at it with the right mindset. 

To avoid feeling anxious about my upcoming exam or test, I try to remind myself that I am more than my grade, that I shouldn't focus too much on getting good grades, and that I just need to make sure I do my best. These reminders prepare me mentally for what's coming and shift my attention away from the result. Instead, they fixate my concentration in the present and help me enjoy the process. I view testing as a great learning opportunity to measure my knowledge of a specific skill in a specific point of time. Even if I fail a test, it is not the end of my life. I only need to identify my weaknesses and mistakes, learn from them, get back up, and do better next time. 

For my upcoming final exam, I try my best to capitalize on scheduling. Before taking this course, I didn't schedule my day or week, which caused me a lot of hours behind the class, stress, pain, and guilt of not being the best I could be. This time I made a detailed schedule to plan my study toward my final. First, I marked down my exam date in my Google Calendar and set notification. Second, I take inventory of all the lessons that were covered during throughout the course. Third, I split those units equally into the days I have left for the exam. Fourth, I set aside 4 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon to study as I know I am productive in the morning. Fifth, most importantly I note in my schedule what the objective for each study session is. I found this very useful, because I would not know what to do when the study hour arrives and could probably end up wasting your time. Last but not least, it's a matter of executing and sticking to the plan. 

# Learning Journal
**Reflection Topic: Learning Outcomes**

Congratulations on reaching the last full week of UNIV 1001: Online Education Strategies. Throughout the term, we have learned a lot together. We have focused on effectively navigating UoPeople courses, understanding the process and impact of peer assessment, and examining and developing key learning skills such as critical thinking and self-directed learning. We have also worked to understand and apply important strategies for reading, studying, APA citations and references, time management, stress management, and test management.

For your last journal entry, reflect on the different things you have learned over the term. Then, in a 300-500 word journal entry (at least 300 words but no more than 500 words), answer the following:

1.  What was the most useful strategy you learned during this course? How will you apply this strategy in your future studies here at UoPeople?
2.  What was the most surprising thing you learned this term? Why did it surprise you?
3.  Peer assessment is a unique education model. Think back to how you felt about peer assessment at the beginning of the term, and compare that to your feelings now. How have your feelings changed? Are you more comfortable with peer assessment? Have you learned something new while assessing your peer’s work?

**APA Exercise**

We have also worked hard to develop our APA skills, so be sure to practice your APA citations and references by including at least two references and two in-text citations. These citations and references should be incorporated into your Reflection - they should not be a separate activity.  

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4).

**Learning Journal Rubric**

The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.

## My Work

The most useful strategy for me throughout this course is active reading. Two of the main problems I had with reading were, first, my attention span, and, second, my ability to comprehend what I have read and to actually retain it. For the attention span aspect, I came to the conclusion that it is really a matter of practice which involves in allocating specific amount of time to sit and disciplining myself to read till the time is up. 

On the other hand, the comprehension and retention part is what I learned the most from this course. I learned that there are three main parts to active reading (*College Success*, 2015, p. 168). Firstly, it is the preparation step. Before you read something, you need to prime yourself to get in the right mood and mindset, eliminate as much distraction as you can, and scan through what you're about to read while asking questions or making comments; imagine you're not reading, but you're conversing with the author. And you need to take note of the questions. 

Secondly, you can now start the actual reading. While you're reading, keep those questions from the previous step in your mind and look for the answers. It can also be very helpful if you can look away after each sentence or paragraph to paraphrase what you have just read. This way you can gauge how much you understand the material. 

Third step, you need to review what you've read. This is where you go through all the questions again and try to answer them while taking note in your own word. It is important to remember that the note has to be paraphrase in your own words in order for the method to be effective. If you can't answer the questions, recall or paraphrase what you have just read, you can read again. 

I think the most surprising thing I learned this term is the fact that to really do well in class, I have to allocate huge amount of time, 15 hours a week, for one course (*Undergraduate Catalog*, 2020, p.69). It's a huge commitment. I have to put in a lot of energy and effort. It was a shock for me because I dropped out of my university in 2017, so I didn't have much experience studying at university, not to mention doing well.

At the beginning of the term, I really didn't have special feeling or anything, because I took an English course before. Thus, I was aware of it and didn't really expect anything. However, having exposed to it for two terms makes me think that the quality of this model depends a lot on how much effort each student is putting into making the best out of it and especially how much effort the instructor puts in to encourage and enforce what it right. 

For that aspect, I am very grateful for you, Ryan. You have shown to us that you actually care and want us to make the best out of our experience through your careful helpful comments or feedback and your sharing of additional resources.  You're a great instructor.
