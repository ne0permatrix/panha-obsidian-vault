# APA Help
The University of the People uses APA (American Psychological Association) as their citation guide. Using APA in your work is very important when you are incorporating information into your writing that is not your own. Doing so is called plagiarism, which is passing off someone else’s work as your own (not acknowledging the author’s work). It is considered stealing and is a very serious academic offense. Please, please, please do not put yourself, the university, and your instructors in this situation; it is not a good place to be, and it’s not fun for anyone involved.  

Fear not, though; we will work on proper APA formatting throughout the course so that you are prepared moving forward. Please take advantage of these resources and post questions when needed:

-   [UoPeople's Learning Resource Center](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963) provides an abundance of valuable information to help you succeed, including information on [APA citations](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963&section=4).  
    

-   [Purdue University’s Online Writing Lab (OWL)](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) is a free website that provides excellent information and resources for understanding and using the APA format and style, including [in-text citations and](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html) [reference lists](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html)[.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html)

-   [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/) is my favorite resource!  
    
**Please note that I have one rule, and it immediately constitutes a zero on the assignment and an official plagiarism report sent to the University: Please do _not_ copy and paste large portions of text to pass off as your assignment, _regardless_ of whether or not it is displayed in proper APA formatting or just has a few words changed. Copying and pasting, as well as heavily paraphrasing, doesn't demonstrate that you have learned the material or produced an original work; it is best to use sources to supplement and support _your_ writing.**

_APA citations are required for all assignments!_
