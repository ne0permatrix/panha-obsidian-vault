# Reading Assignment
## Independent Learning Skills 
Last week, we focused on critical thinking skills. This week, we’re going to focus on ***independent learning skills***. Specifically, we’re going to examine ***self-directed learning*** and how it relates to ***active learning*** and ***motivation***.

Self-directed learning remains one of the most successful learning strategies a student can use. ***Self-directed learners*** tend to be active learners who learn more effectively, retain more of what they learned, and transfer what they have learned to new contexts. As an adult learner, you have probably already realized that learning is a lifelong process, so being able to learn more effectively will benefit you outside the classroom, too.

## Self Directed Learning

A ***self-directed learner*** is someone who takes control of their learning process and takes the initiative to learn. Self-directed learners do not wait for someone to direct them - instead, they recognize that they control what, how, and when they learn. Self-directed learners consistently seek out the opportunity to enrich themselves through learning and are intrinsically motivated to learn.

## Techniques for Active Learning

**Active learning** is when you do activities, such as reading, writing, discussions or problem solving, which encourage you to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate the information being looked at.

**Becoming an active learner**

To become an active learner, you need to think about the information you are reading or listening to, and do something with what you are learning. This could include:

-   Asking questions as you read.
-   Make notes in your own words.
-   Summarizing what you read.
-   Talking to someone about the information you're learning. Use your own words to discuss it with other students, friends or your family. (If you don't have a friend who'll listen, try an imaginary friend, or the family pet.)
-   Thinking about how the new information fits in with things you already know.
-   Thinking about how you can use the new information in your studies and in your everyday life.

**How to apply active learning to your studies**

-   Don't just read your course materials, do all the activities as well.
-   Identify the main points in the material you're reading and highlight them or write them down.
-   Try different ways of writing notes – on paper or cards, in pictures, perhaps put them into a table, a mind map or a list, or record them.
-   Note the things in your course materials that you already know.
-   Log onto the online forum for your course regularly. Ask questions and discuss your ideas with your fellow students.
-   Think of three or four questions you could ask your lecturer/tutor. Then try to answer them yourself. Imagine you had to set the exam - what questions would you include? How would you answer them?

## Successful UoPeople Students
The successful UoPeople student does the following:
-   Takes ownership of the learning process by setting personal educational goals and monitoring their own progress.
-   Pushes to think deeper about issues and draw connections to their personal, academic, and professional lives.
-   Views the instructor as a guide, but themselves as the pursuer of deeper understanding.
-   Learns collaboratively, through peer engagement and feedback.
-   Seeks out the available resources and understands the scope of the University, its departments, and its learning philosophy and approach.
-   Understands the importance of applying the knowledge learned in the classroom to continued personal and career development potential.

Every learner has the capacity to become a self-directed learner. The strategies we learn this week will set the stage for the next few weeks as the foundation of effective time management and study skills.

## APA Skills: Quoting and Paraphrasing
Additionally, we will continue to work on improving our APA skills. In the first four weeks of this class, we focused on learning 4 main types of in-text citations and references to use in our work – books, articles, websites, and video files. While there are many more types of materials that you can cite and reference in your work, mastering these four types gives you an effective foundation – from here, you can easily build on your knowledge and learn how to cite any type of resource you wish. So starting this week, we are going to focus on a different aspect of learning APA: how to effectively paraphrase and how to quote from our readings.

Quoting is using the exact words of the author you’re citing and referencing – you make no changes except to add quotation marks around the words. By using quotation marks, you’re clearly marking that these words are not yours. In contrast, paraphrasing is re-explaining the author’s idea in your own words. Whether you are quoting or paraphrasing, you still use an in-text citation – always. (As a reminder, if you include a reference but not an in-text citation, this is plagiarism. You always need both an in-text citation and a reference at the end of your work.)

Alternately, you can read the [Paraphrasing [PDF]](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408848/mod_book/chapter/301597/Paraphrasing%20Transcript.pdf).  

You can also practice with the following handouts:
-   [Paraphrasing Handout 1](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408848/mod_book/chapter/301597/ParaphrasingH1.pdf)
-   [Paraphrasing Handout 2](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1408848/mod_book/chapter/301597/ParaphrasingH2.pdf)

In this week’s exercise, you’ll get to directly compare quoting and paraphrasing from the same source. As you do, consider this: how do quoting and paraphrasing relate to passive and active learning?

# Discussion Assignment
In this discussion, you will discuss taking ownership of your own learning.

1.  What does it mean to take ownership of your own learning? In your response, describe the difference between active and passive learning.
2.  What is the role of the course instructor in the learning process?
3.  What is the role of peer assessment in the learning process?

**Discussion Requirements**

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used; you should use at least 1 APA citation and reference, but you can use more if needed.  For help with APA citations, please refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) .  

**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

**Rating Discussions**

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

**Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:**

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

## My Work
1. What does it mean to take ownership of your own learning? In your response, describe the difference between active and passive learning.
2.  What is the role of the course instructor in the learning process?
3.  What is the role of peer assessment in the learning process?

The successful UoPeople student does the following:
-   Takes ownership of the learning process by **setting personal educational goals and monitoring their own progress**.
-   **Pushes to think deeper about issues and draw connections** to their personal, academic, and professional lives.
-   Views the instructor as a guide, but themselves as the **pursuer of deeper understanding**.
-   Learns collaboratively, through peer engagement and feedback.
-   **Seeks out the available resources** and understands the scope of the University, its departments, and its learning philosophy and approach.
-   Understands **the importance of applying the knowledge learned in the classroom to continued personal and career development potential**.

Every learner has the capacity to become a self-directed learner. The strategies we learn this week will set the stage for the next few weeks as the foundation of effective time management and study skills.

====
Learning is lifelong education. We all should have this mindset if we want to continue growing and getting better everyday. Whose job is it to make sure that we keep improving every single day? It's no one else's job; it is ours. We need to decide to take ownership of our own learning. But what does it mean to take ownership of our learning endeavor? 

Similar to any other pursuits in life we begin by setting personal educational goals for ourselves.  Then we need to strategically plan the necessary steps required to move us toward achieving those goals by executing the plan. During the execution phase, it is also our sole responsibility to be the pursuer of deeper understanding regarding the issues or topics covered inside or outside class. 

We need to keep in mind that all the information or knowledge we learned will be useless if we don't relate or apply them to our academic, personal, or professional lives. This is where active learning comes into play. Whereas passive learning is teacher-centered meaning students receive information from the instructor through series of lectures, active learning is student-centered where discussion and engagement among everyone in the classroom including the instructor are encouraged (*Passive learning*, 2021.).

To actively learn, we need to analyze—asking question as we read, synthesize—summarizing and making notes in our own words, and internalize the information—thinking of how the new information could fit in the things you already know and thinking about how you can apply them in everyday life ("Techniques for active learning", n.d.). This could involve finding available extra resources and understanding the scope of our university—its departments, learning philosophy and approach—to aid us in our studying (*Successful UoPeople students*, n.d.). 

For example, at UoPeople students are encouraged to learn collaboratively through its peer-assessment model. it is a learning model that allows students to actively learn from each other by participating in the discussion forum where they can share their thoughts or points of view, discuss what their peers have to share, synthesize and internalize new information to form their argument and defend their position, and pushing each other to grow by giving honest and accurate constructive feedback with very minimal dependence on their instructors. 

Throughout our learning journey, our course instructor plays a very crucial role in building a co-operative learning environment, motivating and directing the students, facilitating students' initiatives for learning, and being available for consultations (*Self-directed learning: A four-step process*, n.d.). We as students can view our instructors as a guide—an advisor—rather than a formal instructor. That way it will break the possible barrier or fear that might prevent us from communicating openly, but respectfully, and reaching out for help from them.

## Example of A Good Work from Akinbile Gabriel
(1)

Self-learning is a method of acquiring knowledge through which individuals take ownership of their learning at their own pace. It's an independent way and process of learning that is anchored on the principle of priority and self-motivation.  
  
Active learning goes beyond reading and listening, it involves additional steps into knowing and retaining the acquired knowledge. In this way, the learner will be able to think, process, and apply the information to meaningful use. It's a process of learning that involves students' participation and interaction with information before internalizing; which includes group discussions and peer assessment. Passive learning, on the other hand, is a learning process in which students are required to amass information and internalize it. In this way, they only listen, read and reflect on the information they receive without further reflection or feedback. An example includes podcasts or videos ( Unangst, 2021, April 15).  

(2)

As the name implies, the course instructor is the one in charge of the course-related issues. His or her main role is to guide students along the path of knowledge acquisition, while students should see themselves as seekers of knowledge and understanding. Learning to Learn Online (2018) describes the roles of an instructor in the learning process as follows:  
  
-   **As a Facilitator:** The instructor is responsible for providing learning materials or resources to support students' learning. In this way, he or she also provides helpful tips or instructions for students' learning process.
-   **As a Designer:** This way, the online instructor creates outlines and structures necessary for a significant learning experience for students.
-   **As a Director:** The instructor challenges students to evolve in their knowledge and abilities. He or she also assists in providing answers to their questions. More so, the instructor is responsible for giving instructions and recommend materials necessary for students' success. In addition, he or she is also responsible for grading students' works and oversees their performances.

(3)

Peer assessment plays a key role in the overall learning process and experience of students. Mainly, it's an essential aspect of active learning which enhances and widens the student's knowledge and understanding through knowledge sharing. In this way, students tend to learn better through discussion activities and peer review. It encourages deeper learning among students in a way that their ability to reason and analyze a material will be developed. Also, by assessing others, students are exposed to a myriad of views and different ways of solving problems. In the end, peer assessment challenges the learner's ability to think critically and come out with practical evaluation.

## My Work
What is a self-directed learner? What are the essential aspects of self-directed learning?

A self-directed learner is intrinsically motivated to take initiative, with or without assistance of others, in setting their educational goals, diagnosing their learning needs, identifying human and materials resources for learning, and evaluating their outcomes (Knowles, 1975, p. 18). In another word, they takes ownership of their own learning. An article, "Self-directed learning: A four-step process" (n.d.) claims that there are four key stages of self-directed learning:
	Step 1 - Assess readiness to learn: To make sure that we will have a successful independent study, we need to be assessed to see identify the signs of readiness which includes being autonomous, organized, self-disciplined, able to communicate effectively, and able to accept constructive feedback and engage in self-evaluation and self-reflection. 
	Step 2 - Set learning goals: In this step, it is crucial for individual to set goals and learning contract with the advising instructor. This is done to make sure that student is not going to do too much or too little work, and the timeline is reasonable. 
	Step 3 - Engage in learning process: Students should learn to understand themselves as a learner in order to identify their needs in their self-directed learning endeavor. They also have to assess their teacher and understand their approach to studying which includes a deep approach, surface approach, and strategic approach. 
	Step 4 - Evaluating learning: This is another crucial stage in self-directed learning because it helps students engage in self-reflection and self-evaluation by asking themselves questions such as: How do I know I've learned? Am I flexible in adapting and applying knowledge? Do I have confidence in explaining material? When do I know I've learned enough? When is it time for self-reflection and when is it time for consultation with advising instructor?
	
What are your two biggest strengths as a student? How will these strengths help you become a self-directed learner?

My two biggest strengths as a student are my ability to set goals and evaluating my learning. Being able to set goals for my self-directed learning will give me intrinsic motivation to get myself ready by training to be autonomous, organized, self-disciplined, communicate effectively, accept constructive feedback, and engage in self-reflection. On the other hands, when I have made progress, it is equally important to reflect on it to assess what went right and what needs to be improved. 

What are your two biggest weaknesses as a student? How do these affect your readiness to be a self-directed learner?

My two biggest weakness as a student are being self-discipline and able to communicate effectively. Self-directed learning requires individuals to discipline themselves to set goals, formulate strategic action plan, and consistently put in hours of hard work and dedication to achieve their goals. Along with this, they need to be able to communicate effectively to express their thoughts/opinions, defend their position, or seek out for help and feedback from others. 

Describe at least three strategies to become a more self-directed learner. How will you hold yourself accountable for your growth as a learner?

Out of the "20 steps towards more self-directed learning" (Briggs, 2015), I have chosen three strategies which I think will help me become more self-directed learner:
	1. Identify your learning goals: This for me is very important because it helps me set expectation and organize the other aspects of my life to strategically set action plan to achieve the goals. 
	2. Cultivate intrinsic motivation: With the goals set, it is equally important to have intrinsic motivation to push me through tough times. We all know that learning isn't always easy. It requires tonnes of hard work, patience, commitment, and dedication to persevere and hang in there till the end. 
	3. Pursue knowledge, not good grades: I also find it crucial to keep reminding myself that I am pursuing knowledge not good grades or degree, because whether I like it or not learning is a lifelong process. I want to make sure that I acquire the knowledge to learn how to learn so that I can apply what I learned to alleviate suffering of myself and others'.

# Learning Journal 
**Reflection Topic: Intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation** 

1.  Describe an example of when you were extrinsically motivated by something. What was your goal and what motivated you?
2.  Describe an example of when you were intrinsically motivated by something. What was your goal and what motivated you?
3.  Based on your examples, explain the difference between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Was one more effective? Be sure to reflect on how each type of motivation made you feel.
4.  Finally, based on what you have learned about motivation, describe what motivates you to learn. Are you an intrinsically motivated learner or an extrinsically motivated learner? Why?

Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 300 words (but not more than 500 words).

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. For the past 4 weeks, we have practiced how to cite and reference different kinds materials – books, articles, website, and videos. While there are other kinds of materials that can be cited and referenced, most will be very similar to what you have already learned.

This week, we are going to change our exercises to focus on how to quote and how to paraphrase. Go back to the webpage you found for our Week 2 APA exercise. Then, complete the following exercise:

1.  What was the full reference for the website you found for the Week 2 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week.)
2.  What was the in-text citation for the website you found for the Week 2 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week.)
3.  Find a sentence about water pollution in your webpage, and copy and paste it here.
4.  Take the sentence from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the sentence in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.
5.  Re-read the sentence from #3, and re-write the sentence in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing.)

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4).

## My Work - Reflection
In whatever we do in life, motivation is a very crucial factor that drives us to success despite the hardship and obstacles. Motivation is defined by Vallerand et al. as the underlying “why” of behavior (Vallerand, Pelletier, Blais, Briere, Senecal & Vallieres, 1992, p. 1008). I used to train and compete as road cyclist for Cambodian national team. I worked hard to try to pursue my dream, and I transformed myself from basically no one in cycling to be selected into the national team and then to eventually race in competitions all over South East Asia. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation got me up every morning and drove me to keep on push forward. 

Have you ever kept a record of your studying hour distribution across the week? To most students, the day and time chart would starts low, then gradually rise up, and pick in the last 2-3 days before the assignment deadline. There's no difference when it comes to learning. Motivation does play a role in your studying, but what type of motivation?  
  
What is it that gives you all the focus and strength to stay awake all night for the last two or three days before the deadline? Extrinsic motivation can be explained as, "People behave to attain the desired consequence such as tangible rewards or to avoid a threatened punishment” (Deci & Ryan, 2000, p. 236). It happened to me; I stayed up all night to finish my assignment because I didn't want to fail my class and feel guilty afterward—avoiding a threatened punishment. I kept a record of how many hours I spend each week studying two courses at UoPeople. Based on my record, I normally spend on average 15 hours doing okay work for all my assignments and in terms of my ability to comprehend the lessons covered. I knew that this is not a healthy habit or good practice. Then what else can I do?  
  
That's when intrinsic motivation comes into play. Intrinsic motivation “refers to doing an activity for the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself” (Ryan & Deci, 2000, p. 71). After 4 weeks of a pretty good struggling into my second term at UoPeople, I learned to focus or be in the state of flow and perceive my studying experience as a golden opportunity to learn what I am interested in and wanted to learn which is to learn how to think critically, read comprehensively, write articulately, and communicate effectively. This is the intrinsic motivation that helps me to discipline myself to sit down, get focused, and get lost in the moment studying.  
  
In conclusion, extrinsic motivation might give me the quick push of energy, drive, and focus to get the work done, but it could also give you a pretty good amount of stress and pressure. On the contrary, intrinsic motivation gives your a consistent boost of drive and focus to do the work peacefully moment by moment. In a long run, I think it is healthier. However, I don't lean strongly toward just one side. I believe that both types of motivations have their own place. For example, someday I might not be in a good state of mind to capitalize on my intrinsic motivation because maybe bad things happen to me earlier that day. Then I can use extrinsic motivation to fill in the place. I just need to strategically be aware of them and make the most out of them.

## My Work - APA Exercises

1. What was the full reference for the website you found for the Week 2 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week.)

Denchak, M. (May 14, 2018). _Water pollution: Everything you need to know_. NRDC.  https://www.nrdc.org/stories/water-pollution-everything-you-need-know

2. What was the in-text citation for the website you found for the Week 2 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week.)

"Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment" (Denchak, 2018).

3. Find a sentence about water pollution in your webpage, and copy and paste it here.

Not only is the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of global freshwater resources, with farming and livestock production using about 70 percent of the earth’s surface water supplies, but it’s also a serious water polluter.

4. Take the sentence from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the sentence in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.

"Not only is the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of global freshwater resources, with farming and livestock production using about 70 percent of the earth’s surface water supplies, but it’s also a serious water polluter" (Denchak, 2018).

5. Re-read the sentence from #3, and re-write the sentence in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing.)

Not only does agricultural sector consumes 70 percent of the earth's surface water supplies but it is also known to be a dominant water polluter (Denchak, 2018).
