## Active Reading
Studying and note-taking are a central part of college learning, but **to study effectively, you need to be able to read proficiently**. Reading difficult and detailed text can make it challenging to remember what you have read. Very few people can read a text once and retain all of its details. Learning how to read effectively makes it easier to retain what you have learned. **By reading with a purpose, you will achieve deeper learning**.

Active reading involves deeper engagement with the text before, during, and after reading. A good way to understand active reading is by comparing and contrasting it to what’s sometimes called passive reading. As you read, reflect on your own reading practices. Have you been reading actively, or reading passively?

## Annotating: Creating an Annotation System
Taking notes as you read is one good way to improve knowledge retention. In order to become the most efficient learner, it is important to learn some effective strategies for organizing the information that you read so that you can more easily study it and retain it.

## Note Taking Strategies
Different note-taking strategies may be more effectively used for different applications and types of information. It is helpful to learn each strategy and understand how to best use it and with which type of information or text. Together, reading skills and note-taking skills allow you to study more effectively. This week, you will learn strategies to improve your reading, note-taking, and studying skills.

**Apply**
Select a response for each item below.
**1. When taking notes in class, it is important to…**
- *write down everything the professor says*
	In general, people speak much faster than they write, this means that it is ***next to impossible to copy down every single thing your teacher says*** in a lecture, and by even trying, you will not give yourself time to engage with the content. In order to process the information more effectively, you should spend more time listening than writing.

	***It is also best to put what is being said into your own words, to only summarize the key points of the lecture and to write down any questions that the lecture brings up***. For tips on effective note taking, [visit the Dartmouth Notetaking site](https://students.dartmouth.edu/academic-skills/learning-resources/learning-strategies/notetaking).

- *write your notes in your own words*
	***Writing notes in your own words*** is an important part of note taking as it helps you to interact with the content and to show that you have understood and processed it. If you do copy an important quote down directly, make sure to put it in quotation marks to avoid plagiarizing by accident.

	That being said, it is also important to only ***write down key points***, so that you don’t spend all class writing instead of engaging with the information. It is also good practice to ***write down any questions*** you may have about the content so that you can ask your teacher or fellow students for clarification later.

-  *only summarize the key points*
	***Only writing down key information*** is an important part of note taking, ***as it demonstrates your ability to summarize the content***. Often lecturers will emphasize the most important points through repetition, highlighting key information on the board or PowerPoint slides, or through discussion questions.

	However, it is also important to ***put the information into your own words whenever possible*** and to ***write down any questions*** you may have to ensure that you receive clarification from your teacher or a fellow student after class.

**2. What is the best way to take notes?**
- *By hand*
 	The way you take notes will depend on your personal preference, and the type of class you are taking. In general, taking notes by hand is slower than typing, but it provides you with the flexibility to draw diagrams, arrows or even to include important equations into your notes with ease.

	Also, **because this form of note taking is slower**, you are more **likely to record only what is necessary** and **to put your notes into your own words rather than simply regurgitating the lecture**. Overall this helps with long-term retention of the information. Need proof? Check out this [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away) or this [article from Scientific America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/).

	If you like the idea of hand-written notes, but also want to incorporate technology into your note taking, there are many tablet applications that can help. Try Squid Notes or Evernote to start, though there are many others.
	
- *On a  computer*
	The way you take notes will depend on your personal preference, and the class you are taking. Taking notes on a computer is often much faster than writing them out by hand, and you can easily reformat or add information into your work without having to copy it out again. You can also sync your phone to your computer to access your notes on multiple devices.

	**The downside to computer-based note taking** is that it is fast, so you are ***more likely to write down lectures word for word rather than actually engaging with the content by summarizing it and putting it into your own words***. Studies also show that taking notes by hand helps students retain information better. Need proof? Check out this [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away) or this [article from Scientific America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/).

	Laptops also provide **numerous distractions** and can **cause you to disengage from the lecture**. If you find yourself constantly checking your e-mail or scrolling through Twitter, consider turning off your Wifi, or use an app that temporarily blocks certain sites such as Cold Turkey or Self Control.
	
- *Neither, I don't take notes.*
	Effective note taking is an important tool for improving your knowledge retention and grades. ***Taking notes*** helps you to *pay attention during lectures and focuses your learning*, by ***giving you the opportunity to actively engage with the content***.

	For some information on why you should take notes [visit the Learning Center at UNC Notetaking site](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/effective-note-taking-in-class/).

**3. Which note taking strategy is the best for you?**
- *The Outline Method*
	There is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference.

	This method works well for Humanities classes, especially if you receive an outline from your teacher at the beginning of class, ***however it might be difficult to implement in a really fast paced lecture, or in Science/Math courses that are more fact and formula based***.

	However this format does make it easy to engage with big points and to review what you’ve learned. Consistent formatting and using bullet points will help you to visualize the levels of the hierarchy and to emphasize both the subject’s big topics and their supporting points.

	Using a computer might make it easier to format this type of notes as you can add in extra details later without things getting too messy.
	
- *The Cornell Method*
	There is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference.

	However, the Cornell Method is one of the most endorsed note taking methods for any subject as it provides an excellent format for condensing and organizing notes. By splitting your page into 3 sections you can easily review your notes, ask questions and summaries are divided from the actual lecture notes. This method is***not just useful for basic recall but it also helps with material that requires synthesis or the application of knowledge***.
	
- *The Mind Map Method*
	There is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference.

	Overall the Mind Mapping Method is generally easier on paper than on a computer, but [Coggle](https://coggle.it/) is a free mind map tool that can help. However, this structure ***isn’t great for recording large amounts of information and might be better for brainstorming assignment or essay ideas rather than note taking in class***.

	The Mind Mapping Method is an ***effective way to visualize what you’re thinking*** as smaller concepts branch off from main ideas and show connections. This form ***helps with the visual representation of ideas and concepts*** and ***helps to boost recall and increase memory retention***.
	
- *The Flow Method*
	There is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference.

	This method bears some similarities to mind mapping as you are***to create connections***, ***draw diagrams and make analogies*** during the lecture. There is no specific structure (which can get messy), but ***writing down information in your own words is key***. It’s good for classes that are big idea, rather than fact or statistic heavy and ***might be best for meetings or discussions rather than lectures***.

	It is meant to be the opposite of hierarchical note taking such as the Outline Method as it is more about intuition than structure. The idea behind it is that it will accelerate your learning as you will better absorb the information while listening to the lecture. If done properly, it should minimize the necessity of reviewing.
	
- *The Write on the Slide Method*
	There is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference.

	The Write on the Slide Method is extremely convenient, but only works if your teacher uses PowerPoint slides in their lectures, and also provides them to students before class. However, if they do, this method allows you to simply add to the information on the slides and to spend more time engaging with the class content than furiously writing.

	Because the slides mirror the flow of the lecture, ***this format gives you a good timeline view of the information covered in class and is good for image or graph heavy classes***. However, this method is ***a bit difficult to use if you want to show relationships between the concepts covered***.
	
- *However I feel like taking them that day.*
	At the end of the day, there is no one size fits all form of note taking. The method you choose will depend on the class you are taking and your own personal preference. 
	
	That being said, ***the more consistent you are in your note taking strategy, the better you will get at one particular method***. This will create consistency in your learning and reviewing strategies and improve your learning overall.
	
**4. When should you review your notes?**
- ***My note***
 	- Right after class to identify gap in your understanding and to generate questions. Then continue to review as often as I can (Spacial Repetition). When you review, you should do more than just reading your note. You should try to summarize, mind map, make connections, self-question, meet a friend to explain new concepts. 
	
- *Before a big test or assignment*
	If you only review your notes right before a big test or assignment, you will not give yourself time to think deeply about the content or to make connections.

	Notes are the most beneficial when reviewed right after class and then again as often as is possible to solidify your deep understanding. By doing this, the material will become familiar to you, and studying for exams will become a lot easier.

	***Reviewing your notes means more than just reading them***, try: summarizing, mind mapping, making connections, self-questioning, or meeting with a friend to practice explaining new concepts to each other.
	
- *Right after class*
	By engaging with the material right after class, the information will be fresh in your mind and you will more easily identify any gaps in your understanding and to generate questions to ask your classmates or teacher. It is also good to do some review questions right after class to further check your understanding of new concepts and to put your new knowledge into practice.

	However, ***you must continue to review your notes throughout the semester*** to ensure you are retaining the information and making connections between new and old concepts.

	Reviewing your notes means more than just reading them, try: summarizing, mind mapping, making connections, self-questioning, or meeting with a friend to practice explaining new concepts to each other.
	
- *As often as I can* 
	Reviewing your notes frequently will make the information second nature and will help when it comes to studying for an exam. This means, ***reviewing your notes right after class*** to easily **identify any gaps** in your understanding and to **generate questions** to ask your classmates or teacher and to ***continue this review process as often as you can***.

	However, reviewing your notes means more than just reading them, try: summarizing, mind mapping, making connections, self-questioning, or meeting with a friend to practice explaining new concepts to each other.
	
- *It doesn't matter.*
	It is important to review your notes to ensure that you have thought deeply about your new knowledge and to identify any gaps in your understanding. Reviewing your notes right after class and then again as often as possible is integral to your long term retention of information.

	However, reviewing your notes means more than just reading them, try: summarizing, mind mapping, making connections, self-questioning, or meeting with a friend to practice explaining new concepts to each other.

# Discussion Assignment
After reviewing the reading assignments this week, it’s time to put some of your new note-taking skills to use.  

Choose a note-taking strategy that was presented in the unit. Then, use your note taking strategy to take notes on the following:  

Smith, S., & Smith, R. (2015). _Money trees (No. 663)_ [Audio Podcast Episode]. In _Planet Money_. NPR. [https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/13/455941812/episode-663-money-trees](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/13/455941812/episode-663-money-trees)

1.  What note-taking strategy did you select? Why? (Be sure to attach a copy of your notes to your response - you cannot earn full credit for this assignment without attaching your notes.)
2.  How will the note-taking strategy you selected help you study? How does this compare to other note-taking strategies you looked at this week?

**Discussion Requirements**

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 500 words. Be sure to attach your notes to your discussion post.  

Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.  

**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words).  

**Rating Discussions**

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

**10 (A) -** Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B) -** Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C) -** Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D) -** Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F) -** Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

**Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:**

1.  Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
2.  Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
3.  Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
4.  Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
5.  Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

## My Work
1.  What note-taking strategy did you select? Why? (Be sure to attach a copy of your notes to your response - you cannot earn full credit for this assignment without attaching your notes.)
2.  How will the note-taking strategy you selected help you study? How does this compare to other note-taking strategies you looked at this week?

# Learning Journal
**Reflection Topic: Learning Styles**  

Determining your learning style can be both beneficial and fun.  Go to the [VARK website](https://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/) and learn about the four major learning styles: Visual, Aural (Auditory), Read/Write and Kinesthetic.  Then take the [VARK Questionnaire.](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/) Once you know your style(s) read about the different learning strategies here:

-   [Visual Strategies](http://vark-learn.com/strategies/visual-strategies/)
-   [Aural Strategies](http://vark-learn.com/strategies/aural-strategies/)
-   [Read/Write Strategies](http://vark-learn.com/strategies/readwrite-strategies/)
-   [Kinesthetic Strategies](http://vark-learn.com/strategies/kinesthetic-strategies/)

Once you have completed the readings, answer these questions: 

1.  Was this your first time taking this type of inventory? If no, did your results change from the last time? If so, did your learning style results surprise you?
2.  Now that you have identified your learning style, how will you apply this knowledge to your studying?
3.  Reflect on the studying strategies you have used previously. Have your study habits been effective? Why or why not? What studying strategies from this week do you think will be helpful?

Be sure that your Learning Journal entry is a minimum of 300 words (but not more than 500 words).  

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. For the past 4 weeks, we have practiced how to cite and reference different kinds materials – books, articles, website, and videos. While there are other kinds of materials that can be cited and referenced, most will be very similar to what you have already learned.

Last week, we started focusing on how to correctly quote and how to correctly paraphrase. This week, we will continue this work. Go back to the e-book you found for our Week 1 APA exercise. Then, complete the following exercise:

1.  What was the full reference for the e-book you found for the Week 1 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week).
2.  What was the in-text citation for the e-book you found for the Week 1 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week).
3.  Find a paragraph in your e-book, and copy and paste it here.
4.  Select a section from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the section in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.
5.  Re-read the section from #3, and re-write it in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing).

Note: If you are struggling, try reviewing the [UoPeople APA tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4).

**Learning Journal Rubric**

The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.

 1. Was this your first time taking this type of inventory? If no, did your results change from the last time? If so, did your learning style results surprise you?
2.  Now that you have identified your learning style, how will you apply this knowledge to your studying?
3.  Reflect on the studying strategies you have used previously. Have your study habits been effective? Why or why not? What studying strategies from this week do you think will be helpful?

 ## My Work - Reflection
 
 Yes, this is my first time taking this type of inventory. I have been actually quite aware with my own learning style. I most of the time thought that I am a visual and aural learner. The result came out as a little bit of a surprise actually. It is said, "I am a multimodal learner with high scores in visual, aural, and kinesthetic learning style." It is pretty accurate. I notice that I learn something better and quicker if either I listen to a podcast, an audiobook, a lecture, someone's talking, or an interview; or I watch someone demonstrate to me how to do it and I jump right away into doing it.  On the other hands, when I present the information to others, I like to make sense of the big picture or what I am about to present by scribbling them onto a mindmap-like diagram first before I explain them to others. 
 
 I think I am going to get into the reflection part of my studying strategies first before I talk about how I will apply what I learned from this week to my studying. I do think that my study habits have been pretty effective. Actually, I doubt that. To be honest, how can I correctly or accurately gauge my study habits' effectiveness? 
 
 This term I am taking another course, Principle of Business Management. I am required to read one chapter per week which isn't the volume of reading I am used to. I was not much of a reader before, but now I have to force myself to learn how to read. Taking UNIV1001 actually has helped me a lot already. It taught me how to read actively and effectively. I have noticed some improvement in term of my ability to stay focused while reading. In term of my ability to comprehend what I read, to retain those information, and to synthesize or internalize the information, and my reading speed, I can't really tell. Yesterday, I didn't pretty bad with my graded quiz in my Principle of Business Management class. Also, I did a really bad job with the discussion assignment for UNIV1001. I think it is caused by my poor time management more than my ineffective learning style. 
 
 So far, I think I have been quite effective with my learning style. I am aware that I am a visual and aural learner; therefore, I chose to use mindmap for my notetaking practice. I also try to listen or watch video contents that relate to the topic covered in class so that I can consume the information better. However, the game changer still have to be my ability to straighten out my time management. Please, don't get me wrong. I am working on it, and I am getting better. I knew that those days like yesterday are just part of the process. As long as, I keep being driven, determined, and aware of my studying progress, I will one day reach a point where I don't have to rush to finish my assignment in the last minutes or blindly guess the answers of my graded quiz. Now I think I need to just trust the process and point in more time to doing what I am doing.

 ## APA Exercises

1.  What was the full reference for the e-book you found for the Week 1 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your reference, be sure to write the correct reference this week).

Reference

Delisle, R. (1997, November 01). *How to use problem-based learning in the classroom*. https://cd21kyumz-mp01-y-https-ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lirn.net/lib/univ-people-ebooks/reader.action?docID=280352&query=problem-based+learning

2.  What was the in-text citation for the e-book you found for the Week 1 APA exercise? (If your instructor gave you feedback on how to correct your citation, be sure to write the correct citation this week).

"Problem-based learning (PBL) provideds a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension" (Delisle, 1997, p.2).

3. Find a paragraph in your e-book, and copy and paste it here.

A ll education involves either problem solving or preparation for problem solving. From mathematical calculations (“What does this equal?”) to literary analysis (“What does this mean?”) to scientific experiments (“Why and how does this happen?”) to historical investigation (“What took place, and why did it occur that way?”), teachers show students how to answer questions and solve problems. When teachers and schools skip the problem-formulating stage— handing facts and procedures to students without giving them a chance to develop their own questions and investigate by themselves— students may memorize material but will not fully understand or be able to use it. Problem-based learning (PBL) provides a structure for discovery that helps students internalize learning and leads to greater comprehension. 

4.  Select a section from #3, and using the APA rule for short quotations, put the section in quotation marks while adding an APA in-text citation at the end.

According to Delisle (1997), "When teachers and schools skip the problem-formulating stage— handing facts and procedures to students without giving them a chance to develop their own questions and investigate by themselves— students may memorize material but will not fully understand or be able to use it" (p. 1).

5.  Re-read the section from #3, and re-write it in your own words while adding an APA in-text citation at the end. (This is called paraphrasing).

To be able to synthesize and internalize information better, students need to be fully engaged in identifying the problem or objective for each lesson they are taking, figuring our the solution, and seeking out resources to implement their solution to achieve their objectives (Delisle, 1997, p. 1).
