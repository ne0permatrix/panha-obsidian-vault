## Welcome to University of the People

## Unit 1 Introduction

## Discussion Assignment

For this assignment, write at least 250 words - but no more than 500 words - answering the following question:
- What are the benefits of collaborative learning?
- How does University of the People integrate community-oriented learning into the classroom?
- In your response, be sure to share any experience you have with collaborative learning.

**Discussion Responses**

It is your responsibility to respond to three classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (100 words). Rating Discussions

After posting an appropriate, meaningful, and helpful response to your three classmates, you must rate their posts on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (Excellent). The rating scores are anonymous; therefore, do NOT mention in your remarks the separate rating score you will give the peer. The instructor is the only person who knows which score matches the comment given to a peer. Some classmates may worry that some peers will not provide a fair rating, or be unable to provide accurate corrections for grammar or other errors. It is the instructor’s responsibility to ensure fairness and accuracy.

10 (A) - Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable. 8 - 9 (B) - Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response. 6 - 7 (C) - Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating. 4 - 5 (D) - Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading. 0 - 3 (F) - Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

Here are some questions to consider as we think about the feedback and rating to give our classmates:

-   Did the peer respond to everything asked by the assignment prompt?
-   Was the peer’s overall response organized and logical? Was it easy to follow and smooth?
-   Was it easy to understand the ideas the student was trying to communicate, or did you have to make assumptions to make sense out of what the peer wrote?
-   Did the peer use their own words, or if they borrowed from somewhere else, did they give credit to the source they used?
-   Were there consistent errors in grammar and punctuation that made it hard to understand or make sense out of the writing?
    

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be reviewing responses, ratings, and comments. Your instructor will adjust ratings if he/she believes that they do not seem warranted or supportable.

## Learning Journal

Every week in UNIV 1001, you will complete a Learning Journal assignment. In this class, your Learning Journals are composed of two parts - a reflection topic, and an APA exercise. Your reflection topic should be at least 300 words but no more than 500 words. Reflection Topic: College Success

Write about what college success means to you. How will you define success, and what strategies will you use to achieve success? Be sure to be specific. Do you have any concerns or worries about how you will manage your course assignments or expectations? Your journal entry will only be seen by you and your instructor, so feel free to share any questions and worries you have.

**My Work**

College success for me is more than just passing all the courses and getting the degree. Throughout my college journey, I have three goals in mind. First, I want to be able to apply what I learn from each course to solving problems or make use of what I have learned. Second, I want to be able to make connections with other students. Third, I want to transfer to finish my bachelor degree on campus at McGill University and change my major to Agro-Environmental Science.

To achieve my first goal, I have been making video contents on what I have learned from my previous course at UoPeople. I intentionally make the content in Khmer, my native language, because I believe that it can potentially break the language barrier and reach out further to Cambodian youths, who are in need of good quality world-class content. I know that this doesn't really reflect back directly to my intention to solve real world problems using knowledge I gained from those specific courses, but at least I am making use of what I learned. Hopefully, by sharing my stories or my journey of the pursuit for higher education at UoPeople, I can inspire or give hope to those, who also want to do the same.

For my second goal, I think what I can do is to spend more time and effort to thoroughly participate in course forum, discussion forum, and peer assessment. I think so far I have been doing ok. However, I have a concern that this online collaboration learning and peer-to-peer learning aren't as effective as when we get to do them face-to-face.

That is something I think my third goal, transferring to finish my degree on campus, could tell. I have been contacting my program advisor to seek out for more information about applying to transfer to McGill after I graduate my associate degree. I know that I want to change my major from Bachelor of Science in Business Administration at UoPeople to Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Environmental Science at McGill. Therefore, I need to take science courses during throughout my association degree years. At the same time, I need to review those science courses like biology, mathematics, and physics. I am planning to start with Khan Academy.

Last but not least, I have another concern about how my experience at UoPeople can effectively help me apply what I have learned in real life. So far, I have not seen much project-based learning, which also means my current learning experience lacks hands-on activities. I really wish that UoPeople curriculum can emphasize more on project-based/problem-based learning.

**APA Exercise**

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite an e-book. These are available in the UoPeople library. Start by going to the library and find an e-book on a topic you’re interested in. Then, complete the following exercise:

-   What is the title of the book?
-   Who is the author (or who are the authors)?
-   What year was the book published?
-   What is the URL of the book? 
-   Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the book you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
-   Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the book you found.
    

Refer to the UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC for help in APA citations. Grading Rubric The rubric detailing how you will be graded for this assignment can be found within the unit's assignment on the main course page.
