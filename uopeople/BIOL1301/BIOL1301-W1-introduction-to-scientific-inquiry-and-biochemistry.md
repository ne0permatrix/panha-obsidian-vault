# Introduction
**Biology is the study of life (Bio = life, -ology = study of)**.

**_What is life?_**

Life can be defined as capacity for development, reproduction, metabolism and evolution. We will examine each of these concepts in this course. Life can also be defined as the presence of cells which well will study in this course as well. Life is organized into what we refer to as a biological hierarchy which increases in complexity and inclusiveness including molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems. An ecosystem includes all the living and non-living factors as well as the interaction among them. Biologists busy themselves with studying life at any one or more of these levels of organization. For example, a molecular biologist might spend their career investigating the nature and function of a particular molecule.

**_How is science used to study life?_**

Science is how we answer questions about the physical universe. There are two basic types of science which are based on inductive and deductive reasoning. Using inductive reasoning, a scientist will come to an answer/conclusion based on observation of numerous details. For example, one might conclude that pollution causes a particular disease if an increased frequency of that disease is present in more polluted areas. Using deductive reasoning, a scientist will use a general premise to answer a specific question. This is often referred to as hypothesis-driven science in which an experiment is designed to test a specific hypothesis. An effective hypothesis must be narrow/specific in focus. Based on our example of inductive reasoning, a scientist might hypothesize that a particular pollutant causes a specific disease. A controlled experiment would include two groups in which the only difference between them would be the presence of the pollutant. The pollutant would be the independent variable and the presence of disease would be the dependent variable. Only the experimental group would be exposed to the pollutant and the disease frequency would be measured. Measurement is essential as it allows us to statistically analyze the data. If the disease frequency is significantly higher among the experimental group, the hypothesis is supported.

**_What is biochemistry?_**

If biology is the study of life, then biochemistry can be defined as chemistry as it applies to life. In the assigned readings, you will learn the basic atomic structure and how atoms interact with each other to form molecules. A chemical reaction occurs when chemicals interact with each other to form larger chemicals (anabolism) or when a larger chemical is broken down into smaller component parts (catabolism).

**_What makes water special?_**

Water (H2O) is a polar molecule meaning the charge within water is not equally distributed. Specifically, the oxygen is partially negative and the hydrogens are partially positive. As opposite charges attract, the oxygen of one water molecule forms a chemical bond with the hydrogen of another water molecule. These “hydrogen” bonds hold water molecules together as you might experience if you do a belly flop into a swimming pool - ouch! Water is referred to as the solvent of life meaning that other molecules; e.g., salts and sugars, are dissolved in water. Only other polar and charged molecules can be dissolved in water while non-polar molecules cannot.

**_What makes carbon special?_**

In biology, we can classify molecules as either organic or inorganic with the difference being the presence of carbon. Carbon-based molecules are organic, while all others are inorganic. Interesting, as water, while essential for life, is NOT organic based on this definition. A carbon atom has the ability to form chemical bonds with up to four other atoms. In your readings, you will study a variety of carbon-based molecules including sugars/carbohydrates, lipids/fats, proteins, and nucleic acids.

## My Work
Scientists attempt to comprehend the world and the way it operates through the use of two methods of logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. "Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion" ( Rye et al., 2013, p. 10). What that means is that a scientist or someone can formulate a generalization about an event or a phenomenon by observing and analyzing my samples. For example, after many time of observing that we get rushes on our skin whenever we eat seafood, we can come to a conclusion that we might be allergic to seafood. On the other hands, deductive reasoning uses general principles or laws to predict particular outcomes (Rye et al., 2013, p. 10). For example, we know that lion is a carnivore. Then we can make a prediction that a baby pig would be eaten if we put it in a room with a starving lion. 

Which, if any, type of reasoning is best used to establish cause and effect relationships?

I think that deductive reasoning is best used to establish cause and effect relationships because it is a hypothesis-based method of logical thinking meaning because we use existing principles or laws to guess the outcome of an event. Thus, as long as the general principle remains true, our prediction is likely to be true to as a result of the effect of our general principle or law. For example, based on Newton's Law of universal gravitation, we can tell that a rock is going to fall back down to the ground if we throw it up in the air.

# Written Assignment
Dieting is common in our society and everyone wants a piece of the action. So many diets are available to choose from if someone wants to change their health; e.g., lose weight. Often times, diets are promoted with claims of great success.

For the purposes of this assignment, you are to choose a particular diet and analyze it in terms of scientific evidence, or lack thereof. Then, you are to design a controlled experiment to test a hypothesis based on this diet. The experiment must include multiple individuals within a control and experimental group. You must specify how you will measure the outcome of the experiment identifying both the independent and dependent variables. You must describe the potential outcomes of the experiment in terms of supporting the hypothesis.

Write a 2-3 page (500 – 750 words, 12 point font) paper including the following elements. Be sure to compose your work with your own words. Do not copy and paste from any source.

-   Describe the basic nature of the diet including the reasoning for how it works.
-   Analyze the diet for any scientific evidence to support its effectiveness.
-   Design a controlled experiment to test the effectiveness of the diet. 
-   Use in-text citation and provide source references for at least 3 sources. The textbook can be one source.
-   Check all content for grammar, spelling and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used. Refer to the [UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC](https://my.uopeople.edu/course/view.php?id=3963#section-4) for help with APA citations.

# My Work

To begin with, let's start with an observation where we notice people in our society are mostly obese. Then we can ask a question, what cause people to develop diabetes? In the attempt to answer that question, we establish a hypothesis which states that high-carbohydrate diet lead to gaining weight. To understand why we came up with this hypothesis, we should understand how our body works in term of carbohydrate metabolism. 

"Carbohydrate metabolism is important in the development of type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body can’t make enough insulin or can’t properly use the insulin it makes" (*Carbohydrate and blood sugar*, n.d.). When we eat food containing carbohydrates, our digestive system breaks the digestible carbohydrates into sugar, which enters the blood. As a result, our blood sugar levels rise, and pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that triggers cells to absorb blood sugar to make energy or for storage. As cells absorb blood sugar, its levels in the bloodstream falls which prompts pancreas to make glucagon which is a hormone that signals the liver to start releasing stored sugar because the whole objective of this mechanism is to ensure that cells throughout the body especially in the brain have a steady supply of blood sugar. Over time, the heavy demands made on the insulin-making cells wears them out, and insulin production eventually stops which causes blood sugar to stay high long after eating. This is why we get obese. 

With the above hypothesis, we can predict that if we eliminated carbohydrate and sugar from our diet, we would loss weight. Now we need to design an experiment to test if this prediction is true or not. We will have two groups with people aging between 30 to 35 years old. One group will be called group A and another one group B. There are 10 people in each group. Group A will be our controlled group. People in this group will eat their usual diet for the next 3 months while people in group B, the experimental group, will be eating diet without carbohydrates. In this experiment, independent variable would be the type of diet we give to each group because it doesn't depend on or get affected by anything. In contrast, the dependent variable would have to be the weigh of the people in each group because the weigh can go up or down depending on the type of diet they eat. To identify the outcome, we need to record everyone's weight before and after the experiment.  We are expecting that people in the controlled group are going to gain weight whereas those in the experimental group are going to lose weight.
