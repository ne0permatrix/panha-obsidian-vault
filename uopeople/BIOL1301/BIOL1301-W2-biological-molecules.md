# Introduction

As you know, organic molecules are distinguished from inorganic molecules based on the presence of carbon. Carbon’s properties allow a large variety of molecules to be formed. Organic molecules can more commonly be referred to as biological molecules. Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids are the four major classes of biological macromolecules. These are all large molecules necessary for life. Each are built from smaller organic molecules.

**_How are macromolecules formed and broken down?_**

Macromolecules are made up of single units known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers (Biology, 2013). Monomers form covalent bonds with each other with the release of a water molecule. These synthesis reactions are referred to as dehydration or condensation reactions. When polymers are broken down into smaller units, a molecule of water is used for each bond broken. These degradation reactions are referred to as hydrolysis reactions. Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all four types of biological macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration reactions require energy as a new bond is formed. Hydrolysis reactions release energy as covalent bonds are broken.

**_What’s in a biological molecule?_**

Each of the four types of macromolecules is composed of unique monomers/building blocks and thus unique chemical properties. Carbohydrate monomers are monosaccharides; e.g., glucose and fructose. Monosaccharides form disaccharides; e.g., glucose and fructose combine to form table sugar – sucrose. Much larger polysaccharides include the energy storage molecules of starch and glycogen.

Lipids are nonpolar and, therefore, no water soluble – hydrophobic. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats serve as an efficient energy store and are referred to as triglycerides. Each fat is composed of fatty acid chains and either glycerol or sphingosine backbone. Phospholipids make up the bulk of cellular membranes. Like fats, they have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains bind. The difference lies in a phosphate-containing group attached to the backbone. As phosphate is charged, the phospholipid molecule is amphipathic – both hydrophobic and hydrophilic. All steroids are synthesized from cholesterol and thus contain carbon rings rather than a linear structure. Cholesterol along with phospholipids can be found in cell membranes where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane.

Proteins are composed of amino acids of which there are 20 biologically relevant. Each amino acid has an nitrogen-containing amino group, a carboxylic acid, and a “R” group which makes the amino acid unique. Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA – our genetic material. Nucleic acids are synthesized from nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring. It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.

# Discussion
In your assigned readings, you learned about biological molecule synthesis and degradation. Our cells are busy both building and breaking down macromolecules for both structural and functional purposes. Enzymes are necessary for the effective synthesis and degradation of macromolecules. Metabolic diseases result from either the lack of or defective enzymes. For this discussion, you will select a specific metabolic disorder. Describe the defect in metabolism responsible for the disorder identifying any enzyme(s) involved. Analyze the symptoms of the disease based on the metabolic disturbance. Discuss therapy available for treatment of the disorder. Does the therapy treat the symptoms or the metabolic nature of the disease? Explain.

Be sure to use in text citation and provide references for your sources. While not required for this discussion, you may use outside resources. Any materials cited in this course should be referenced using the APA style guidelines  Purdue University’s Online Writing LAB (OWL) is a free website that provides excellent information and resources for understanding and using the APA format and style. The OWL website can be accessed here: [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/)

**After posting your discussion on the forum, briefly comment in a constructive manner to at least three of your peer's postings.** In your comments, you may for instance refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. You may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions, if you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience. In particular, make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it.

Discussion Forum Rating Guidelines:

**10 (A)** - Excellent, substantial, relevant, insightful, enriching, and stimulating contribution to the discussion. Also, uses external resources to support position where required and/or applicable.  
**8 - 9 (B)** - Good, quite substantial and insightful, but missing minor details which would have otherwise characterized it as an excellent response.  
**6 - 7 (C)** - Satisfactory insight and relevance, but required some more information and effort to have warranted a better rating.  
**4 - 5 (D)** - Limited insight and relevance of the material; more effort and reflection needed to have warranted a satisfactory grading.  
**0 - 3 (F)** - Unsatisfactory insight/relevance or failure to answer the question, reflecting a poor or limited understanding of the subject matter and/or the guidelines of the question.

## My Work
"Metabolic disease is any disease or disorder that disrupt normal metabolism the process of converting food to energy  on a cellular level" (Enns, n.d.). What it really means is that this type of disease affects crucial biochemical reactions such as molecule synthesis—dehydration synthesis or hydrolysis—and degradation. These reactions are responsible for processing or transporting proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids in our body. 

For this assignment, I selected a metabolic disease known as diabetes mellitus. "Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism characterized by impaired ability of the body to produce or respond to insulin and thereby maintain proper levels of sugar glucose in the blood" (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.)

To understand the what cause diabetes mellitus we need to know what role insulin plays within our body. Insulin is an hormone secreted by beta cells in our pancreas for triggering cells to take up glucose to produce energy. When beta cells are dysfunctional, insulin is inadequately produced or our body becomes resistant to the effect of insulin; therefor, our body loses its ability to take up and metabolize glucose.  

"Treatment for diabetes mellitus is aimed at reducing blood glucose concentrations to normal levels" (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.). At an early stage, patients are encouraged to exercise regularly and eat diet with caloric restriction so that they can maintain normal body weight. For those patients whose bodies can't produce insulin, they are required to take insulin therapy which basically means regular injections of insulin hormone into the body. Last but not least, medication can be used to control blood glucose levels. 

The treatment of diabetes mellitus isn't really treating the nature of the disease, instead it is treating the symptoms. Type 1 	diabetes isn't preventable because it's caused by a problem in our gene or immune system. Hence, it isn't under our control. However, some people diagnosed with prediabetes can be delay and prevented with healthy lifestyle.
